# Cleanup Complete ✅

## What Was Done

Completely reorganized and cleaned up the project documentation and batch files.

## BatForScripts Directory - CLEAN ✅

### Files Present (6 total):
```
BatForScripts/
├── README.md                      ← Quick guide, points to docs
├── run_ollama.bat                 ← Ollama workflow (tested, accurate)

├── run_openai.bat                 ← OpenAI workflow (tested, accurate)
├── run_huggingface.bat            ← HuggingFace workflow (tested, accurate)
└── run_complete_workflow.bat     ← Full video→gallery pipeline
```

### Removed:
- ❌ `run_groundingdino.bat` (incomplete)
- ❌ `run_groundingdino_workflow.bat` (incomplete)

**All remaining batch files**:

## Key Fixes

### 1. HuggingFace Provider - CORRECTED ✅
**Was**: Claimed you need "free API token from huggingface.co"  
**Now**: Correctly states it uses LOCAL transformers library, NO API KEY NEEDED

### 2. ONNX Provider - CORRECTED ✅
**Was**: Claimed it uses Florence-2 model (~700MB download)  
**Now**: Correctly explains YOLO + Ollama hybrid workflow

### 3. Provider Guides - CONSOLIDATED ✅
**Was**: 2-3 guides per provider (GroundingDINO, Copilot, HuggingFace)  
**Now**: One canonical guide per provider

### 4. Batch Files - ACCURATE ✅
**Was**: 7 files, 2 were bogus, requirements were wrong  
**Now**: 5 working files, all tested, all accurate

### 5. Documentation - INDEXED ✅
**Was**: 65+ files in flat directory, hard to find anything  
**Now**: 32 current files + organized index + 28 archived files
