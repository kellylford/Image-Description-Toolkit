## Verification Results

### All Vision Models Have Batch Files ✅
Your installed vision models:
- moondream (1.7GB)
- llava, llava:7b, llava:13b, llava:34b
- llava-llama3, llava-phi3
- bakllava
- llama3.2-vision, llama3.2-vision:11b
- minicpm-v, minicpm-v:8b
- qwen2.5vl
- gemma3
- mistral-small3.1, mistral-small3.2

**Total: 16 vision models, all with working batch files**

### Non-Vision Models (No Batch Files Needed) ℹ️
- gpt-oss - Text-only reasoning model (20.9B, supports tools & thinking)
- llama3.1 - Text-only model (8B, supports tools)

These models don't support vision/image input, so they don't need batch files in the image description workflow.

## Current State

### Working Batch Files: 35
- 16 Ollama vision models
- 10 Cloud models (OpenAI + Claude)
- 4 API key management
- 5 Test & utility scripts

### Test Scripts
- `allmodeltest.bat` - Tests all 16 Ollama models
- `allcloudtest.bat` - Tests all 10 cloud models
- `install_vision_models.bat` - Installs verified models only

## Why This Happened

The models `cogvlm2` and `internvl` were added in commit `fe4f39a` (Oct 6, 2025) without verification. These model names don't exist in the Ollama registry. They may have been:
1. Confused with models from other frameworks (HuggingFace)
2. Placeholder names for models that were never released
3. Mistaken model names

Verification:
```bash
$ ollama pull cogvlm2:latest
Error: pull model manifest: file does not exist

$ ollama pull internvl:latest
Error: pull model manifest: file does not exist
```

The Ollama library (https://ollama.com/library) was searched and confirmed these models don't exist.

## Testing Your System

Run the comprehensive test with your prompt tracking:
```bash
# Test all 16 Ollama models with both prompts
cd bat
allmodeltest.bat <your_test_images> colorful
allmodeltest.bat <your_test_images> artistic

# Then analyze with prompt column
cd ..\analysis
python combine_workflow_descriptions.py --output combined_results.csv
```

This will create a CSV with:
- Image Name column
- **Prompt column** (new!)
- 16 model columns (one per vision model)
- Each (image, prompt) combination gets its own row

## Files Modified

- `bat/run_ollama_cogvlm2.bat` - **DELETED**
- `bat/run_ollama_internvl.bat` - **DELETED**
- `bat/install_vision_models.bat` - Updated model list
- `bat/INVENTORY.md` - Updated counts and removed entries
- `bat/allmodeltest.bat` - Removed non-existent model calls
- `Descriptions/wf_ollama_cogvlm2*` - **DELETED** (empty directory)
- `Descriptions/wf_ollama_internvl*` - **DELETED** (empty directory)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All references to non-existent models have been removed. The system is now clean and all batch files reference only verified, working models.
