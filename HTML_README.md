# Descriptions to HTML Converter

This script converts the `image_descriptions.txt` file generated by ImageDescriber to a beautifully formatted HTML web page.

## Features

- **Structured Layout**: Each photo is formatted with proper HTML headings
- **Flexible Display**: Choose between minimal view (name + description) or full view with metadata
- **Metadata Organization**: All metadata is neatly organized in lists under a "Details" section (when using --full)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly styling with clean typography
- **Table of Contents**: Automatically generated for files with more than 5 images
- **Professional Styling**: Modern CSS with color-coded sections
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Meets accessibility standards with proper color contrast

## HTML Structure

### Default Structure (Minimal View)
For each image, the HTML follows this structure:
- **H2**: Photo filename
- **H4**: "Description" heading
- **Paragraph**: AI-generated description text

### Full Structure (--full option)
When using the `--full` option, each image includes:
- **H2**: Photo filename
- **H3**: "Details" section containing:
  - File path
  - Photo date
  - Location (GPS coordinates)
  - Camera information
  - Technical settings
  - AI model used
  - Prompt style
  - Generation timestamp
- **H4**: "Description" heading
- **Paragraph**: AI-generated description text

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Integration with ImageDescriber

This script is designed to work with the output from `image_describer.py`. The typical workflow is:

1. Generate descriptions: `python image_describer.py my_photos/`
2. Convert to HTML (minimal): `python descriptions_to_html.py`
3. Or convert with full details: `python descriptions_to_html.py --full`
4. Open `image_descriptions.html` in your web browser

The `--full` option is particularly useful when you want to see all the metadata extracted from your images, including camera settings, GPS coordinates, and technical information. The default minimal view is perfect for quick browsing of just the image names and AI-generated descriptions.

## Output Statistics

The script provides helpful statistics after conversion:
- Total number of entries processed
- Number of entries with metadata
- Location of the generated HTML file
