## Directory Structure Created by Installers

When users run the installation scripts, they get:

```
idt/
├── idt.exe                      Main toolkit executable
├── bat/                         Example batch files
├── docs/                        Documentation
├── scripts/                     Configuration files
├── Descriptions/                Output directory
├── analysis/                    Analysis tools
│   └── results/                Analysis results
├── Viewer/
│   ├── viewer.exe              Standalone viewer
│   ├── README.txt              Viewer documentation
│   └── LICENSE.txt             License
├── ImageDescriber/
│   ├── imagedescriber.exe      GUI application
│   ├── README.txt              ImageDescriber documentation
│   └── LICENSE.txt             License
└── PromptEditor/
    ├── prompteditor.exe        Prompt editor
    ├── README.txt              Prompt editor documentation
    └── LICENSE.txt             License
```

## Package Requirements

The installers expect these packages (all with matching version numbers):

### Architecture-Independent
- `ImageDescriptionToolkit_v*.zip` - Main toolkit

### AMD64-Specific
- `viewer_v*_amd64.zip`
- `prompt_editor_v*_amd64.zip`
- `imagedescriber_v*_amd64.zip`

### ARM64-Specific
- `viewer_v*_arm64.zip`
- `prompt_editor_v*_arm64.zip`
- `imagedescriber_v*_arm64.zip`

## Key Features

### 1. Version-Agnostic Package Detection
Uses wildcards to match any version number, so installers work with any release.

### 2. Validation
- Checks for all required packages before starting
- Reports specific missing packages
- Exits cleanly if packages are missing

### 3. Safety Features
- Detects existing `idt/` directory
- Prompts user before overwriting
- Allows cancellation

### 4. Clear Progress Reporting
```
[1/4] Installing main IDT toolkit...
[2/4] Installing Viewer...
[3/4] Installing Prompt Editor...
[4/4] Installing ImageDescriber...
```

### 5. Post-Installation Guidance
Provides clear next steps:
- Install Ollama
- Pull vision model
- Run interactive guide
- Add to PATH (optional)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Download**
   - User downloads all packages and installer for their architecture
   - Places files in empty folder

2. **Run Installer**
   - Double-click `install_idt_amd64.bat` or `install_idt_arm64.bat`
   - Installer validates packages
   - Creates directory structure
   - Extracts all packages

3. **Post-Installation**
   - Clear instructions displayed
   - User installs Ollama
   - Runs `idt guideme` for interactive setup

## Integration with Build Process

The `packageitall.bat` script now:

1. Packages all four applications (existing)
2. **NEW**: Copies installation scripts to `releases/`
3. **NEW**: Copies `RELEASES_README.md` to `releases/README.md`

This means every release automatically includes:
- All application packages
- Both installers (AMD64 and ARM64)
- Comprehensive README with installation instructions

## Benefits

### For End Users
- **Simple Installation**: One command to install everything
- **No Manual Extraction**: Automated and error-free
- **Clear Instructions**: README and post-install guidance
- **Architecture Support**: Works on both AMD64 and ARM64

### For Developers
- **Automated Distribution**: Installers included in every release
- **Consistent Structure**: Users always get correct directory layout
- **Reduced Support**: Fewer installation-related questions
- **Professional Polish**: Complete, user-friendly release packages

### For the Project
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Easier for new users to try
- **Better First Impression**: Professional installation experience
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for users and maintainers

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Run `packageitall.bat`
2. Navigate to `releases/`
3. Create test folder
4. Copy all packages + appropriate installer
5. Run installer
6. Verify structure and executables

### Test Cases
- ✅ All packages present → Successful installation
- ✅ Missing package → Clear error message
- ✅ Existing `idt/` directory → User prompted
- ✅ Extraction failure → Error reported
- ✅ Post-install instructions displayed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements documented in `docs/INSTALLATION_SCRIPTS.md`:

1. **Auto-Detection**: Single installer that detects architecture
2. **Cross-Platform**: Shell script versions for Linux/macOS
3. **Checksum Verification**: Verify package integrity
4. **Uninstaller**: Clean removal script
5. **Update Script**: In-place updates

## Accessibility Considerations

The installers are designed to be accessible:
- Clear console output with step-by-step progress
- Descriptive messages for screen readers
- User confirmation prompts
- Specific, actionable error messages
- Pauses at completion for review

## Commit Message Suggestion

Add automated installation scripts for IDT releases

Created two installer batch files (AMD64 and ARM64) that automate
the installation of the complete Image Description Toolkit from
release packages.

Features:
- Automatic package detection and validation
- Creates proper directory structure (idt/Viewer/ImageDescriber/PromptEditor)
- Extracts all four packages to correct locations
- Safety checks for existing installations
- Clear error messages and progress reporting
- Post-installation guidance

Files added:
- install_idt_amd64.bat - AMD64 installer
- install_idt_arm64.bat - ARM64 installer
- RELEASES_README.md - End-user installation guide
- docs/INSTALLATION_SCRIPTS.md - Developer documentation

Modified:
- packageitall.bat - Now copies installers and README to releases/

This makes it much easier for end users to install IDT from GitHub
releases with a single command instead of manual extraction.
```

## Related Work

This builds on the release infrastructure work done previously:
- `packageitall.bat` - Master packaging script
- Individual package scripts for each application
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds
- Release directory structure

## Impact on Workflow

### For Release Process
No changes to existing workflow - installers are automatically included.

### For Users
Significant improvement:
- **Before**: Download 4 packages, manually create directories, extract each
- **After**: Download packages + installer, run one command

### For Documentation
New user-facing documentation makes installation clear and reduces confusion.

## Notes

- Installers use PowerShell's `Expand-Archive` for extraction
- Works on Windows 10 and later (PowerShell built-in)
- No additional dependencies required
- Architecture-specific to avoid confusion with mismatched packages
