# ImageDescriber.Full - Professional WPF Edition

## Overview

ImageDescriber.Full is a comprehensive WPF application for AI-powered image description, built as a professional replacement for the Python Qt6 ImageDescriber application. It features a modern .NET 8 architecture with dependency injection, MVVM patterns, and support for multiple AI providers.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8 WPF** - Modern Windows Presentation Foundation
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** - MVVM implementation with RelayCommand and ObservableProperty
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DI** - Dependency injection container
- **Newtonsoft.Json** - JSON serialization for workspace files
- **Multiple AI Providers** - OpenAI, Ollama, and Hugging Face support

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ UI Data Binding Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed `SelectedProviderName` vs `SelectedProvider` property mismatch
- Changed `AvailableProviders` to return `AIProviderInfo` objects with DisplayName/Value
- Added progress binding properties: `ProgressValue`, `ProgressText`
- Added `StatusPrefix` property to ImageItem model for batch marking display

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// Fixed property binding
public string? SelectedProviderName => SelectedProvider?.DisplayName;

// AIProviderInfo class for proper ComboBox binding
public class AIProviderInfo
{
    public string DisplayName { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public bool IsAvailable { get; set; }
}

// Progress properties for UI feedback
[ObservableProperty] private double _progressValue;
[ObservableProperty] private string _progressText;
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed IDW File Loading (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Implemented proper async `LoadWorkspaceAsync()` method with `IWorkspaceService`
- Added comprehensive error handling for file loading failures
- Implemented proper UI refresh after successful workspace load
- Added progress reporting during load operations

**Implementation:**
```csharp
[RelayCommand]
private async Task OpenWorkspace()
{
    var openFileDialog = new OpenFileDialog
    {
        Filter = "ImageDescriber Workspace (*.idw)|*.idw",
        Title = "Open Workspace"
    };

    if (openFileDialog.ShowDialog() == true)
    {
        await LoadWorkspaceAsync(openFileDialog.FileName);
    }
}
```

### 3. ✅ Real AI Model Detection (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Implemented real API calls for OpenAI, Ollama, and HuggingFace providers
- Added proper model discovery methods for each provider
- Implemented graceful error handling for provider connection failures
- Added fallback model lists when providers are unavailable

**Implementation:**
- **OpenAI Provider**: Fetches real models via `/v1/models` endpoint
- **Ollama Provider**: Connects to local Ollama instance via `/api/tags`
- **HuggingFace Provider**: Uses curated list of vision-capable models

### 4. ✅ Image Preview Display (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Created `FilePathToImageSourceConverter` for proper image binding
- Added error handling for missing/corrupt images with fallback behavior
- Implemented proper image loading with memory management (CacheOption.OnLoad)
- Fixed XAML binding to use converter for file path to ImageSource conversion

**Implementation:**
```xml
<Image Source="{Binding SelectedImageItem.FilePath, Converter={StaticResource FilePathToImageSourceConverter}}"
       Stretch="Uniform" MaxWidth="800" MaxHeight="600"/>
```

### 5. ✅ Workspace Tree View Population (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed ItemsSource binding to use `WorkspaceItems` ObservableCollection
- Implemented proper selection binding with `SelectedImageItem` property
- Created functional batch marking checkboxes in item templates
- Added automatic UI updates when workspace changes

**Implementation:**
```xml
<ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding WorkspaceItems}"
         SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedImageItem}"
         ItemTemplate="{StaticResource WorkspaceItemTemplate}"/>
```

### 6. ✅ Processing Engine Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added comprehensive error handling to AI processing with try/catch blocks
- Implemented proper progress reporting with percentage and text updates
- Fixed threading issues in batch processing with proper async/await patterns
- Completed stop processing functionality with CancellationToken support

**Features:**
- Individual image processing with real-time progress
- Batch processing with cancellation support
- Proper error recovery and user feedback
- Auto-selection of newly generated descriptions

### 7. ✅ Description Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Implemented edit description functionality with InputBox dialog
- Added delete description with confirmation dialog
- Enhanced copy to clipboard with error handling
- Added automatic description selection when processing completes

**Commands Available:**
- Edit Description (with simple text input)
- Delete Description (with confirmation)
- Copy Description to Clipboard

### 8. ✅ Error Handling and User Feedback (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added comprehensive try/catch blocks around all critical operations
- Implemented user-friendly error messages via MessageBox
- Added input validation for required fields (API keys, file selection)
- Added status bar notifications for all user operations

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Building and Running

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the application
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

### 2. First-Time Setup

1. **Configure AI Providers** (via environment variables or configuration):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI GPT-4 Vision
   - `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` - For Hugging Face models
   - Ensure Ollama is running locally for local models

2. **Test Provider Connection**:
   - Select an AI provider from the dropdown
   - Click "Refresh Models" to verify connection
   - Available models will populate if connection is successful

### 3. Basic Workflow

1. **Create/Open Workspace**:
   - File → New Workspace (or Ctrl+N)
   - File → Open Workspace... (for existing .idw files)

2. **Add Images**:
   - File → Add Directory... (select any image in target folder)
   - File → Add Files... (select individual images)

3. **Process Images**:
   - Select image from workspace list
   - Configure AI provider and model
   - Process → Process Selected Image
   - Or mark multiple images and Process → Process Batch

4. **Manage Descriptions**:
   - View descriptions in right panel
   - Edit, delete, or copy descriptions as needed
   - Multiple descriptions per image supported

5. **Save Work**:
   - File → Save Workspace (Ctrl+S)
   - File → Save Workspace As... for new location

## AI Provider Configuration

### OpenAI
- Requires API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Supports GPT-4 Vision models
- Handles base64 image encoding automatically

### Ollama (Local)
- Requires Ollama service running on localhost:11434
- Supports any vision-capable model (llava, moondream, etc.)
- No API key required

### Hugging Face
- Requires API key in `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Supports image captioning models (BLIP, GIT, etc.)
- Uses Inference API endpoints

## File Format

### .idw Workspace Files
```json
{
  "version": "3.0",
  "directory_paths": ["C:/path/to/images"],
  "items": {
    "image_path": {
      "file_path": "C:/path/to/image.jpg",
      "descriptions": [...],
      "batch_marked": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No models available"**:
   - Check AI provider connection
   - Verify API keys are configured
   - For Ollama, ensure service is running

2. **Image preview not showing**:
   - Verify image file exists and isn't corrupted
   - Check file permissions
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, HEIC

3. **Workspace won't load**:
   - Verify .idw file isn't corrupted
   - Check that referenced image files still exist
   - File paths are automatically updated when possible

4. **Processing fails**:
   - Check internet connection for cloud providers
   - Verify API rate limits aren't exceeded
   - Check error messages in status bar

### Performance Tips

- Use batch processing for multiple images
- Local Ollama models are faster but may be less accurate
- Processing automatically includes delays to prevent API rate limiting
- Large images are automatically optimized before sending to AI providers

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced prompt customization
- Video frame extraction integration
- HEIC conversion tools
- Export descriptions to various formats
- Advanced AI settings dialog
- Workspace templates and presets

## Technical Notes

- Built with accessibility in mind using WPF accessibility patterns
- Memory-efficient image loading with proper disposal
- Async/await patterns throughout for responsive UI
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Modular architecture allows easy addition of new AI providers
