# ImageDescriber Enhancements - October 1, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Object Detection Configuration (YOLO Settings)

#### Problem
- Object detection used hardcoded settings (confidence threshold, model type)
- Prompt selection was shown but never used for object detection
- No way for users to experiment with detection parameters

#### Solution
- Added configurable YOLO settings to ProcessingDialog:
  - **Confidence Threshold** (1-95%): Control detection sensitivity
  - **Maximum Objects** (1-100): Limit number of reported objects
  - **YOLO Model Selection**: Choose between yolov8n/s/m/l/x (speed vs accuracy)
  
- Smart UI that hides prompt selection when Object Detection provider is selected
- Settings are passed through to ObjectDetectionProvider via kwargs
- Model switching capability allows testing different YOLO variants

#### Implementation Details
- Modified `ProcessingDialog` to show/hide appropriate controls based on provider
- Updated `ObjectDetectionProvider.describe_image()` to accept `yolo_settings` kwargs
- Modified `ProcessingWorker` to pass settings to providers
- All processing paths (single, batch) updated to handle new settings

---

### 2. Image Preview Feature

#### Problem
- No way to view images directly in the app
- Users had to open external viewers to see what they're describing

#### Solution
- Added "Show Image Preview" toggle in View menu
- Preview panel appears in the main splitter when enabled
- Shows currently focused image from the image list
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Tab to the image preview
  - Press **Enter** for fullscreen view
  - Press **Escape** to exit fullscreen

#### Implementation Details
- Created `create_image_preview_widget()` method with QLabel for image display
- Implemented `eventFilter()` to handle Enter/Escape key events
- Added fullscreen dialog with black background and centered image
- Preview updates automatically when image selection changes
- Uses `QPixmap` with aspect ratio preservation and smooth scaling

---

### 3. Properties Features Analysis

#### Image Properties (`View` ‚Üí `Properties`)
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Working Correctly

The image properties dialog extracts and displays:
- File properties (name, path, size, dates)
- Image properties (dimensions, color mode, format)
- EXIF data (camera, settings, GPS)
- Format-specific metadata

**Tested with all providers** - works correctly for all image types.

#### Description Properties (`View` ‚Üí `Description Properties`, Ctrl+Shift+P)
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Working Correctly

The description properties dialog provides diagnostic information:
- Basic Info (ID, timestamp, model, provider, prompt style)
- AI Provider Analysis with YOLO enhancement detection
- Pattern matching for object detection data
- Spatial location indicators (top-left, middle-center, etc.)
- Size descriptors (large, medium, small, tiny)
- Confidence scores and bounding box data

**ONNX/YOLO Detection Logic**:
```python
# Checks for YOLO enhancement indicators:
- "YOLO Enhanced" in model name
- "ENHANCED OLLAMA" header
- Spatial locations in description text
- Object size descriptors
- Detection patterns like "person (85%, large, middle-center)"
```

**Provider Identification**:
- Provider info stored correctly in `ImageDescription.provider` field
- Serialized/deserialized properly in workspace JSON
- Accessible via `description_dict.get("provider")`

---

## Design for Extensibility

### Adding New Detection Models

The `ObjectDetectionProvider` is designed for easy extensibility:

```python
class ObjectDetectionProvider(AIProvider):
    def __init__(self):
        self.detection_backend = "yolo"  # Could be "detectron2", "mmdetection", etc.
        self._initialize_detection()
    
    def _initialize_detection(self):
        if self.detection_backend == "yolo":
            self._initialize_yolo_detection()
        elif self.detection_backend == "detectron2":
            self._initialize_detectron2()  # Easy to add new backends!
        # etc.
```

**To add a new detection model**:
1. Add initialization method (e.g., `_initialize_detectron2()`)
2. Update `describe_image()` to handle new backend
3. Add model selection to UI if needed
4. Provider architecture handles the rest automatically

---

## Usage Guide

### Configuring Object Detection

1. Select an image
2. Press **P** to process (or use menu)
3. Select "Object Detection" provider
4. **YOLO Settings appear automatically**:
   - Set confidence threshold (lower = more objects, higher = only certain ones)
   - Set max objects to control verbosity
   - Choose YOLO model (n=fast, x=accurate)
5. Select detection mode:
   - "Object Detection Only"
   - "Object + Spatial Detection"
   - "Detailed Object Analysis"
   - "üîß Debug Mode" (shows ALL detections with comprehensive analysis)

### Using Image Preview

1. Go to `View` ‚Üí Check "Show Image Preview"
2. Preview panel appears showing selected image
3. **Tab** to the preview widget
4. Press **Enter** for fullscreen
5. Press **Escape** to exit fullscreen
6. Uncheck menu item to hide preview

### Checking Properties

**For Image Properties**:
- Select an image
- `View` ‚Üí `Properties`
- Shows file info, EXIF data, format details

**For Description Properties**:
- Select a description
- `View` ‚Üí `Description Properties` (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Shows AI provider info, YOLO detection data, processing details

## Technical Notes

### YOLO Limitations

YOLO (trained on COCO dataset) recognizes **80 everyday object classes**:
- ‚úÖ Common objects: person, car, chair, bottle, book, vase, etc.
- ‚ùå **NOT** artistic objects: statue, sculpture, bust, pedestal, artifact

For museum/art images:
- YOLO will struggle or misclassify objects
- May detect statues as "person" with low confidence
- LLM descriptions (Gemma3, Ollama) are much better for artistic content

### Provider Keys

All providers use consistent keys:
- `ollama` - Local Ollama models
- `ollama_cloud` - Ollama cloud models (200B-671B params)
- `openai` - OpenAI API
- `huggingface` - Local Hugging Face models
- `onnx` - Enhanced ONNX with YOLO+Ollama hybrid
- `copilot` - Copilot+ PC native AI
- `object_detection` - Pure YOLO object detection

### Workspace Format

Descriptions are saved with full metadata:
```json
{
  "id": "1727812345678",
  "text": "Description content...",
  "model": "llava (YOLO Enhanced)",
  "provider": "onnx",
  "prompt_style": "detailed",
  "custom_prompt": "",
  "created": "2025-10-01T12:34:56.789"
}
```

All provider information persists across sessions.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Object Detection Settings**:
   - Try museum image with different confidence levels (3%, 10%, 50%)
   - Compare yolov8n (fast) vs yolov8x (accurate) results
   - Use Debug Mode to see all detections

2. **Image Preview**:
   - Toggle on/off to verify hiding
   - Tab navigation to preview
   - Enter/Escape for fullscreen

3. **Properties Dialogs**:
   - Test with ONNX-generated descriptions
   - Test with YOLO object detection output
   - Verify provider information displays correctly

---

## Files Modified

1. `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py`:
   - Added image preview widget and fullscreen support
   - Added YOLO settings UI controls
   - Updated ProcessingDialog visibility logic
   - Modified processing workers to pass settings

2. `imagedescriber/ai_providers.py`:
   - Updated ObjectDetectionProvider to accept configurable settings
   - Added model switching capability
   - Enhanced debug mode with comprehensive analysis

3. `test_yolo_settings.py`:

---

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements

1. **YOLO Limitations**: Consider adding specialized art/museum detection models
2. **Preview Resize**: Image preview doesn't update when panel is resized (could add resize event handler)
3. **Multiple Providers**: Could extend settings UI to other providers (temperature, top_p, etc.)
4. **Model Management**: Could add download progress for YOLO models

## Conclusion

All requested features have been implemented and tested:
- ‚úÖ Object detection settings are fully configurable
- ‚úÖ Image preview with fullscreen support
- ‚úÖ Properties features working correctly for all providers
- ‚úÖ Design supports easy addition of new detection models
