# EXECUTABLE BUILD - QUICK REFERENCE

## Your Question Answered

**Q: Do the batch file changes get checked into my repository?**

**A: NO! Your repository stays unchanged.**

Here's what happens:

### Your Repository (Git) - NEVER MODIFIED ✅
```
bat/run_ollama_llava.bat:
    python workflow.py --model ollama/llava ...
    ^^^^^^ Stays as "python" - works for development
```

### Distribution ZIP - AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED 📦
```
releases/ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.0.0.zip:
    bat/run_ollama_llava.bat:
        ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe workflow --model ollama/llava ...
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Converted at build time
```

### How It Works
1. `create_distribution.bat` copies your files to `releases/staging/` (temporary)
2. PowerShell command converts batch files **in staging only**
3. ZIP is created from staging
4. Staging directory is deleted
5. **Your original bat/ files are never touched**

## Build System Status

### ✅ Ready to Build
- Python 3.13.7 in .venv
- PyInstaller 6.16.0 installed
- All infrastructure files created:
  - `idt_cli.py` - CLI dispatcher
  - `ImageDescriptionToolkit.spec` - PyInstaller config
  - `build.bat` - Build script (auto-detects venv)
  - `create_distribution.bat` - Package creator (auto-converts batch files)

---

## Regular Build Process (When You Want to Release)

### Step 1: Update Version (Optional)
```bash
# Edit VERSION file
echo 1.1.0 > VERSION
```

### Step 2: Build Executable (~3-5 minutes)
```bash
build.bat
```

**What happens:**
- Detects your .venv automatically
- Cleans previous builds
- Runs PyInstaller
- Creates `dist/ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe` (~150-200 MB)
- Tests executable with version command

**Your files:** ✅ UNCHANGED

### Step 3: Create Distribution Package (~1-2 minutes)
```bash
create_distribution.bat
```

**What happens:**
- Creates temporary `releases/staging/` directory
- Copies exe, batch files, docs, configs
- **Converts batch files in staging** (python → exe)
- Creates `releases/ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.0.0.zip` (~90-100 MB)
- Deletes staging directory

**Your files:** ✅ STILL UNCHANGED

### Step 4: Verify (Recommended)
```bash
git status
```

**You should see:**
```
Untracked files:
  dist/
  releases/
  build/
  
# No modifications to tracked files!
```

**Your bat/ files:** ✅ STILL call "python workflow.py"

---

## Build Frequency

### When to Build
- ⏰ **Before releasing** to end users (every few weeks)
- ⏰ **After major changes** you want to test as exe
- ⏰ **When ready to share** with non-Python users

### When NOT to Build
- ❌ During daily development (use Python directly)
- ❌ For testing changes (use Python version)
- ❌ Just to commit code (exe is git-ignored)

## File Locations After Build

```
Your Repository (Git):
├── bat/
│   ├── run_ollama_llava.bat        "python workflow.py ..."  ✅
│   └── run_claude_opus4.bat        "python workflow.py ..."  ✅
├── workflow.py                     ✅ Unchanged
├── idt_cli.py                      ✅ New (dispatcher)
├── ImageDescriptionToolkit.spec    ✅ New (PyInstaller config)
├── build.bat                       ✅ New (build script)
├── create_distribution.bat         ✅ New (package script)
└── VERSION                         ✅ Unchanged

Build Artifacts (Git-Ignored):
├── dist/
│   └── ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe    (~150-200 MB)
├── releases/
│   └── ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.0.0.zip  (~90-100 MB)
└── build/                             (temporary, auto-deleted)

Distribution ZIP Contents:
├── ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe
├── bat/
│   ├── run_ollama_llava.bat        "ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe workflow ..."
│   └── run_claude_opus4.bat        "ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe workflow ..."
├── Descriptions/  (empty)
├── analysis/results/  (empty)
├── scripts/  (configs)
├── docs/  (documentation)
└── README.md, LICENSE, VERSION
```

## Daily Development Workflow

### You Continue Working With Python (As Normal)
```bash
# Edit code
code workflow.py

# Test with Python
python workflow.py --model ollama/llava ...

# Or use batch files (they call Python)
bat\run_ollama_llava.bat

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push
```

**No build needed!** Your batch files work with Python.

---

## Release Workflow (Occasional)

### When Ready to Ship to Users
```bash
# Update version
echo 1.1.0 > VERSION

# Build (~5 minutes total)
build.bat
create_distribution.bat

# Verify
git status  # Should show no tracked file changes
dir releases  # Should show ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.1.0.zip

# Upload to GitHub Releases
# (Upload releases/ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.1.0.zip)

# Continue development
# (Your bat files still work with Python!)
```

---

## Test Results Summary

### Environment Verified ✅
- Python: 3.13.7 in .venv
- PyInstaller: 6.16.0
- Build script: Auto-detects venv
- All files created successfully

### Ready to Test First Build
The infrastructure is complete. When you're ready:
1. Run `build.bat` (will take 3-5 minutes)
2. Check `dist/ImageDescriptionToolkit.exe` is created
3. Run `create_distribution.bat` (will take 1-2 minutes)
4. Check `releases/ImageDescriptionToolkit_v1.0.0.zip` is created
5. Run `git status` to verify no repository changes

---

## What You Can Do Right Now

### Option 1: Test Build Immediately
```bash
# Takes ~5-7 minutes total
build.bat
create_distribution.bat

# Verify nothing changed in repo
git status
```

### Option 2: Continue Development
```bash
# Your batch files work right now with Python
bat\run_ollama_llava.bat

# Build later when ready to release
```

### Option 3: Test Just the Build Script
```bash
# See if build.bat detects everything correctly
build.bat
# (Will take 3-5 minutes to build exe)
```

## Key Takeaway

**🎯 Your repository NEVER changes during the build process.**

- ✅ Batch files stay as `python workflow.py`
- ✅ You keep developing with Python
- ✅ The conversion happens **only inside the distribution ZIP**
- ✅ Users get exe version, you use Python version
- ✅ Both coexist perfectly!

The `update_batch_files_for_exe.py` script I created earlier is **NOT needed** for this approach. The `create_distribution.bat` script does the conversion automatically in the staging area.

## Next Steps

1. **Now (Optional):** Test build with `build.bat`
2. **Now (Optional):** Test distribution with `create_distribution.bat`
3. **Verify:** Run `git status` - should show no tracked file changes
4. **Later:** When ready to release, repeat build → distribute → upload

**Your development workflow:** Completely unchanged! ✨
