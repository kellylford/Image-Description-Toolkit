# GroundingDINO Check Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** check_models.py incorrectly reported GroundingDINO as not fully installed

## Problem

The `check_groundingdino_status()` function was checking for model files in `imagedescriber/groundingdino/` directory, which don't exist and aren't needed. 

GroundingDINO models are downloaded automatically from HuggingFace Hub on first use and cached in `~/.cache/groundingdino/`, not in the project directory.

## Root Cause

**Incorrect assumption:** The check function assumed model files needed to be present in the project directory before GroundingDINO could be used.

**Reality:** GroundingDINO works like HuggingFace models - the package installation is sufficient, and models download automatically on first use.

## Solution

Updated `check_groundingdino_status()` to:

1. **Check package installation** - Verify `groundingdino` package can be imported
2. **Check model cache** - Look for downloaded models in `~/.cache/groundingdino/`
3. **Report correct status:**
   - Package installed + model cached = "Fully configured (model cached: X MB)"
   - Package installed, no cache = "Package installed (model will download on first use, ~700MB)"
   - Package not installed = "groundingdino package not installed"

## Before vs After

### Before (Incorrect)
```
GroundingDINO (Object Detection)
  [--] Status: Package installed but model files missing
```

This was confusing because:
- Package was installed ✅
- It was ready to use ✅
- But reported as "missing files" ❌

### After (Correct)
```
GroundingDINO (Object Detection)
  [OK] Status: Package installed (model will download on first use, ~700MB)
  Models: 1 available
    • GroundingDINO (Text-Prompted Detection)
```

Now correctly shows:
- Package installed ✅
- Ready to use ✅
- Clear expectation about first-use download ✅

## Virtual Environment Note

The confusion was also caused by checking outside the virtual environment:
- Global Python: GroundingDINO NOT installed
- `.venv` Python: GroundingDINO IS installed (v0.4.0)

Always activate the virtual environment before checking:
```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
python -m models.check_models --provider groundingdino
```

## How GroundingDINO Actually Works

1. **Installation:** `pip install groundingdino-py` (or run install_groundingdino.bat)
2. **First Use:** Model downloads automatically (~700MB) to `~/.cache/groundingdino/`
3. **Subsequent Uses:** Uses cached model, no download needed
4. **No Project Files:** Models don't need to be in the project directory

This is identical to how HuggingFace Transformers works.

## Files Modified

- `models/check_models.py` - Fixed `check_groundingdino_status()` function

## Testing

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/Scripts/activate

# Check GroundingDINO specifically
python -m models.check_models --provider groundingdino

# Check all providers
python -m models.check_models

# Verify import works
python -c "import groundingdino; print('Version:', groundingdino.__version__)"
```
