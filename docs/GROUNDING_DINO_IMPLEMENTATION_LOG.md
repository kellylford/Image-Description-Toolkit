Implement GroundingDINO text-prompted object detection with full chat integration for ImageDescriber.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. GroundingDINOProvider Class (ai_providers.py)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What was implemented**:
- Standalone provider for text-prompted zero-shot object detection
- Supports unlimited object types (vs YOLO's 80 classes)
- Multiple default detection modes:
  - Comprehensive (general objects, people, vehicles, etc.)
  - Indoor scenes (furniture, electronics, decorations)
  - Outdoor scenes (vehicles, buildings, nature)
  - Workplace safety (equipment, hazards, safety gear)
  - Retail/store (products, shelves, signage)
  - Document/text (logos, diagrams, text)
- Custom query support: User can type any detection prompt
- Smart location detection: Describes where objects are (top-left, center, etc.)
- Size classification: Objects categorized as small, medium, large
- Confidence scoring: Each detection has confidence percentage

**Key Features**:
```python
# Default prompts for different scenarios
self.default_prompts = {
    'comprehensive': "objects . people . animals . vehicles . furniture . electronics",
    'indoor': "people . furniture . electronics . decorations . appliances",
    'outdoor': "people . vehicles . buildings . trees . sky . roads . signs",
    # ... more presets
}

# Detection with custom queries
detections = provider.describe_image(
    image_path="photo.jpg",
    custom_query="red cars . people wearing hats . safety equipment"
)
```

**Output Format**:
```
üéØ GroundingDINO Detection Results
==============================================================

Query: 'people . vehicles . furniture'

üìä Summary: Found 8 objects across 3 categories

‚úì People: 3 instance(s) [avg confidence: 89.3%]
  #1: Location: top-left, Size: medium, Confidence: 92.0%
  #2: Location: middle-center, Size: medium, Confidence: 89.0%
  #3: Location: bottom-right, Size: small, Confidence: 87.0%

‚úì Vehicles: 2 instance(s) [avg confidence: 85.5%]
  #1: Location: middle-left, Size: large, Confidence: 88.0%
  #2: Location: bottom-center, Size: medium, Confidence: 83.0%

‚úì Furniture: 3 instance(s) [avg confidence: 81.7%]
  Location: top-right, Size: small, Confidence: 85.0%
  Location: middle-center, Size: medium, Confidence: 82.0%
  Location: bottom-left, Size: small, Confidence: 78.0%

üí° Tips:
‚Ä¢ Use chat to refine: 'find only red objects', 'show people with hats'
‚Ä¢ Combine with Ollama for detailed descriptions
‚Ä¢ Lower confidence to find more, raise to reduce false positives
```

### 2. GroundingDINOHybridProvider Class (ai_providers.py)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What was implemented**:
- Combines GroundingDINO detection with Ollama vision descriptions
- Two-stage analysis:
  1. **Stage 1**: GroundingDINO detects all objects
  2. **Stage 2**: Ollama generates natural description using detection context
- Detection results passed to Ollama as context for better descriptions
- User gets both structured detection data AND natural language description

**Workflow**:
```python
# 1. Detect objects
detections = grounding_dino.detect(image, "people . furniture . electronics")

# 2. Format for Ollama
detection_summary = "- people: 3x (at top-left, center, bottom-right)
                     - laptop: 1x (at center)
                     - chairs: 4x (at various locations)"

# 3. Enhanced prompt
enhanced_prompt = f"""
Describe this image in detail. The following objects were detected:
{detection_summary}

Please provide a comprehensive description incorporating these objects.
"""

# 4. Get Ollama description
description = ollama.describe(image, enhanced_prompt)

# 5. Combine results
```

**Output Format**:
```
üîç GroundingDINO + Ollama Analysis
==============================================================

üìä Detection Summary (8 objects found):
people: 3, laptop: 1, chairs: 4

üìù Detailed Description:
The image shows an office meeting room with three people seated around 
a conference table. There are four chairs total, with one empty seat 
suggesting someone may have stepped away. A laptop is open on the table, 
likely being used for a presentation or video call. The people appear 
to be engaged in discussion, with one person gesturing toward the laptop 
screen. The room has a professional atmosphere with modern office furniture.
```

### 3. Provider Registration (ai_providers.py)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What was added**:
```python
# Global provider instances
_grounding_dino_provider = GroundingDINOProvider()
_grounding_dino_hybrid_provider = GroundingDINOHybridProvider()

# Added to get_available_providers()
if _grounding_dino_provider.is_available():
    providers['grounding_dino'] = _grounding_dino_provider

if _grounding_dino_hybrid_provider.is_available():
    providers['grounding_dino_hybrid'] = _grounding_dino_hybrid_provider

# Added to get_all_providers()
'grounding_dino': _grounding_dino_provider,
'grounding_dino_hybrid': _grounding_dino_hybrid_provider
```

**Result**: Both providers now appear in the provider dropdown when GroundingDINO is installed.

## üöß In Progress

### 4. UI Controls in ProcessingDialog
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

**Need to add**:
- Detection mode selector (radio buttons):
  - `(*) Automatic (comprehensive scan)`
  - `( ) Custom query`
- Custom query text input field (enabled when Custom selected)
- Detection preset dropdown (for automatic mode):
  - Comprehensive, Indoor, Outdoor, Workplace, Retail, Document
- Confidence threshold slider (0.1 to 0.9, default 0.35)
- Help text with example queries

**UI Layout**:
```
[GroundingDINO Settings]

Detection Mode:
  (*) Automatic  ( ) Custom Query

Preset: [Comprehensive (Auto)  ‚ñº]

Custom Query: [________________________________]
             (e.g., "red cars . people wearing hats")

Confidence: [====|====] 0.35
            Low          High

[?] Tips: Use periods (.) to separate terms
```

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### 5. Chat System Integration
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Plan**:
- Parse chat messages for detection refinement requests
- Detect queries like:
  - "find red objects"
  - "show only people"
  - "are there any safety hazards?"
  - "what text is visible?"
- Re-run GroundingDINO with new query
- Append results to chat thread
- Allow iterative refinement

**Implementation approach**:
```python
def parse_chat_for_detection_query(message: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Extract detection query from chat message"""
    keywords = ["find", "show", "detect", "locate", "search for"]
    if any(kw in message.lower() for kw in keywords):
        # Extract query terms
        # Return detection query string
```

---

### 6. Visual Feedback - Bounding Boxes
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Plan**:
- Draw detection boxes on image preview
- Show labels with confidence scores
- Color-code by confidence:
  - Green: >80% (high confidence)
  - Yellow: 50-80% (medium)
  - Red: <50% (low confidence)
- Toggle on/off in View menu
- Save annotated image option

**Technical approach**:
- Store detection boxes in workspace metadata
- Overlay boxes using QPainter when preview updates
- Implement as separate layer that can be toggled

## üí° Design Decisions Made

1. **Two Providers vs One**: Created separate providers for standalone detection and hybrid (with Ollama) for flexibility

2. **Default Presets**: Included 7 preset detection modes for common scenarios, making it easy for users without requiring custom queries

3. **Location Descriptions**: Added "top-left", "center", etc. to make detection results more understandable

4. **Size Classification**: Categorize objects as small/medium/large based on image area percentage

5. **Return Format**: Providers can return either formatted text OR raw detection data (for hybrid mode)

6. **Confidence Thresholds**: Made box_threshold configurable (default 0.35) to balance detection quantity vs quality

7. **Error Messages**: Included installation instructions and troubleshooting in error messages

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- **Multi-image queries**: "Find all images with red cars"
- **Temporal comparison**: "What objects were added/removed between images?"
- **Interactive selection**: Click objects in preview to refine detection
- **Export annotated images**: Save with bounding boxes
- **Batch detection**: Process multiple images with same query
- **Detection history**: Remember recent queries
- **Smart suggestions**: AI suggests relevant queries based on image content
- **Confidence heatmap**: Visual representation of detection certainty
