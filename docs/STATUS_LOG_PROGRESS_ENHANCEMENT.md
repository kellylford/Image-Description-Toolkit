# Status Log Progress Tracking Enhancement - Future Improvement Planning

## Current Issue

The workflow status log (`status.log`) was designed to show real-time progress during image description, but currently only updates when workflow steps complete or fail, not during active processing.

### Current Behavior

**What Works:**
- Status log shows overall workflow progress (X/Y steps completed)
- Updates at step boundaries (start, success, failure)
- Shows completion statistics after each step

**What's Missing:**
- Real-time progress during image description (e.g., "Processing image 45/150...")
- Live updates while the AI model is working
- Progress indication during long-running operations

### Technical Root Cause

**Code Location:** `scripts/workflow.py` lines 651-658 and 260-264

**The Issue:**
1. **Setup is correct**: Status tracking initializes with `'in_progress': True` and total image count
2. **No incremental updates**: Image description runs as single subprocess call to `image_describer.py`
3. **Subprocess isolation**: `image_describer.py` doesn't report progress back to workflow
4. **Status only updates**: When subprocess completes (success/failure), not during execution

```python
# Current approach - no progress during execution:
self.step_results['describe'] = {
    'in_progress': True,
    'total': len(combined_image_list),
    'processed': 0  # This never updates during processing!
}
self._update_status_log()

# Long-running subprocess with no progress reporting:
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
```

## Enhancement Options

### Option 1: Progress File Monitoring (Recommended - Low Risk)

**Approach:**
- Modify `image_describer.py` to write progress to a simple file (`progress.txt`)
- Have `workflow.py` monitor this file while subprocess runs
- Update status log periodically with current progress

**Implementation:**
```python
# In image_describer.py:
def update_progress(current, total, output_dir):
    progress_file = Path(output_dir) / "progress.txt"
    with open(progress_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{current}/{total}")

# In workflow.py:
def monitor_progress_during_subprocess(self, cmd, progress_file, total_images):
    # Start subprocess without capture_output to allow monitoring
    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    
    while process.poll() is None:
        if progress_file.exists():
            try:
                with open(progress_file, 'r') as f:
                    progress = f.read().strip()
                    current = int(progress.split('/')[0])
                    self.step_results['describe']['processed'] = current
                    self._update_status_log()
            except: pass
        time.sleep(2)  # Check every 2 seconds
    
    return process.communicate()
```

**Benefits:**
- Minimal risk - doesn't change core image description logic
- Real-time progress updates
- Simple file-based communication
- Easy to implement and test

**Effort:** ~30 lines of code, low complexity

### Option 2: Direct Integration (Medium Risk)

**Approach:**
- Import `image_describer` logic directly instead of subprocess
- Use Python callback functions for progress updates
- Eliminate subprocess boundary

**Implementation:**
```python
# Instead of subprocess, direct import:
from imagedescriber import ImageDescriber

def progress_callback(current, total):
    self.step_results['describe']['processed'] = current
    self._update_status_log()

describer = ImageDescriber()
describer.process_images(images, callback=progress_callback)
```

**Benefits:**
- True real-time callbacks
- No file I/O overhead
- Better error handling

**Risks:**
- Changes established subprocess architecture
- Potential import/dependency issues
- More complex testing required

### Option 3: Log Output Parsing (Low-Medium Risk)

**Approach:**
- Monitor stdout/stderr from `image_describer.py` subprocess
- Parse progress indicators from log output
- Extract progress without file communication

**Implementation:**
```python
# Monitor subprocess output in real-time:
process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)

for line in iter(process.stdout.readline, ''):
    # Parse progress from log output like "Processing image 45/150"
    match = re.search(r'Processing.*?(\d+)/(\d+)', line)
    if match:
        current, total = int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2))
        self.step_results['describe']['processed'] = current
        self._update_status_log()
```

**Benefits:**
- No additional files required
- Uses existing log output
- Minimal changes to image_describer.py

**Risks:**
- Dependent on log format consistency
- Regex parsing can be fragile

## Implementation Priority

### Current Status
**Priority:** Low-Medium (Nice to have for user experience)
**User Impact:** Medium (users want to see progress during long operations)
**Technical Risk:** Low (Option 1) to Medium (Option 2)
**Development Effort:** Small (~30 lines) to Medium (~100 lines)

### Recommendation

**For Next Release:**
- Implement Option 1 (Progress File Monitoring)
- Safe, simple, effective
- Provides immediate user value

**Future Consideration:**
- Option 2 for more integrated solution
- When refactoring subprocess architecture

## User Experience Impact

### Before Enhancement
```
⟳ Image description in progress...
[Long wait with no updates]
✓ Image description complete (150 descriptions)
```

### After Enhancement
```
⟳ Image description in progress: 1/150 images described
⟳ Image description in progress: 23/150 images described
⟳ Image description in progress: 45/150 images described
...
✓ Image description complete (150 descriptions)
```

## Testing Requirements

**For Option 1 Implementation:**
- Test with various image counts (1, 10, 100+ images)
- Verify progress file cleanup after completion
- Test behavior when progress file is corrupted/missing
- Ensure status log updates don't impact performance
- Test with different AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude)

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Progress file deletion during processing
- Subprocess termination before completion
- Very fast processing (progress updates too quick)
- Network interruptions during cloud AI processing

## Performance Considerations

**Status Update Frequency:**
- Current recommendation: Check every 2 seconds
- Avoid excessive file I/O during processing
- Balance responsiveness vs. overhead

**File I/O Impact:**
- Progress file writes are minimal (just "45/150")
- Read operations are lightweight
- Cleanup required after completion

## Implementation Notes

**Files to Modify:**
1. `scripts/workflow.py` - Add progress monitoring
2. `imagedescriber/image_describer.py` - Add progress reporting
3. Add tests for progress tracking functionality

**Configuration Options:**
- Progress update interval (default: 2 seconds)
- Enable/disable progress tracking
- Progress file location override
