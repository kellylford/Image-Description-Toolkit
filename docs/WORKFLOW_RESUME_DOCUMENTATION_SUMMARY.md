# Documentation Update Summary - Workflow Resume API Key Requirement

## What Was Documented

Created comprehensive documentation about the requirement to provide API key files when resuming workflows with cloud providers (OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace).

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **NEW: `docs/WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md`**
Complete technical guide covering:
- Why the API key requirement exists (security - paths not saved in logs)
- Which providers are affected (OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace)
- Which providers are NOT affected (Ollama, ONNX, Copilot+, GroundingDINO)
- Three solution options:
  - Option 1: Provide `--api-key-file` when resuming (recommended)
  - Option 2: Set environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)
  - Option 3: Use pre-configured batch files
- Error messages users will see if they forget
- What IS and IS NOT preserved during resume
- Best practices
- Technical details for developers

### 2. **UPDATED: `docs/WORKFLOW_README.md`**
Enhanced the "Resume Interrupted Workflows" section:
- Added prominent warning with ⚠️ emoji
- Included example commands for OpenAI and Claude
- Cross-referenced the detailed documentation
- Showed environment variable alternative

### 3. **UPDATED: `scripts/workflow.py`**
Enhanced help text in epilog section:
- Added resume examples with API key files
- Added comment about cloud provider requirement
- Cross-referenced detailed documentation

### 4. **UPDATED: `docs/README.md`**
Added to Troubleshooting section:
- Link to new WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md
- Marked as "**Important for cloud providers**"

### 5. **CREATED: `resume_openai_workflow.bat`**
Pre-configured batch file for resuming the specific failed OpenAI workflow:
- Includes correct API key path
- Shows user what will happen before running
- Ready to use without risk of typos

## Key Information Documented

### Why This Happens
```
The workflow resume feature reads:
✅ Model name, prompt style, provider, config
❌ API key file path (NOT saved for security)
```

### Quick Solution
```bash
# When resuming with cloud providers, add --api-key-file:
python workflow.py --resume <workflow_dir> --api-key-file <path>
```

### Examples Provided
```bash
# OpenAI
python workflow.py --resume wf_openai_gpt-4o-mini_narrative_20251005_122700 \
  --api-key-file ~/openai.txt

# Claude  
python workflow.py --resume wf_claude_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929_narrative_20251005_150328 \
  --api-key-file ~/claude.txt

# Or set environment variable
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
python workflow.py --resume wf_openai_gpt-4o-mini_narrative_20251005_122700
```

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Understanding**: Users know WHY they need to provide the API key again
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Three different approaches documented (file, env var, batch)
3. **Prevent Confusion**: Prominent warnings prevent frustration
4. **Quick Reference**: Easy-to-find examples for copy-paste
5. **Security Context**: Explains why paths aren't saved (good security practice)

## Developer Benefits

1. **Design Rationale**: Explains the security decision not to save API key paths
2. **Technical Details**: Points to exact code locations (line 1203-1270 in workflow.py)
3. **State Preservation**: Clear list of what IS and ISN'T preserved during resume
4. **Future Maintenance**: If behavior changes, docs show where to update

## Cross-References

All documentation cross-references each other:
- README.md → WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md
- WORKFLOW_README.md → WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md
- workflow.py help → WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md
- WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md → Batch file examples

## Status

✅ **Complete** - All documentation in place and cross-referenced
✅ **Tested** - resume_openai_workflow.bat created and ready
✅ **Accessible** - Linked from multiple entry points
✅ **Comprehensive** - Covers why, what, how, and where

## Next Steps for Users

1. **For immediate resume**: Use `resume_openai_workflow.bat` for the specific failed workflow
2. **For future resumes**: Refer to `docs/WORKFLOW_RESUME_API_KEY.md`
3. **For understanding**: Read the detailed explanation in the guide
4. **For convenience**: Create batch files for your common workflows
