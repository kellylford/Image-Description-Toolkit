# 2025-10-28 CI/CD Automation Summary

## Overview

Automated continuous integration (CI) and build testing is now fully implemented for the Image Description Toolkit. All core unit tests, syntax checks, and build steps run automatically on every push and pull request—no user involvement required.

## What Runs Automatically

- **Unit Tests**: 39/39 passing (as of this commit)
  - Metadata extraction and format string safety
  - GPS/EXIF parsing, date formatting, and camera info
  - Workflow config race condition and frozen mode path resolution
  - Name sanitization and directory naming (case preservation, punctuation removal)
  - Status log content (ASCII-only, no Unicode)
- **Syntax/Import Checks**: All main scripts checked for syntax errors and import failures
- **Build Verification**: PyInstaller build runs on Windows runner; verifies idt.exe is created and of expected size

## How It Works

- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on every push/PR
- **Custom Test Runner**: `run_unit_tests.py` bypasses pytest buffer issues on Python 3.13
- **No External API Calls**: Tests do not call Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, or geocoding APIs
- **Cost**: $0 for public repos; ~6–9 minutes of runner time per push

## What’s Caught Automatically

- Format string injection bugs (e.g., EXIF with `{}`)
- Config file race conditions (flush/fsync/delay)
- Path resolution errors in frozen mode
- Build failures and missing dependencies
- Syntax/import errors
- Name sanitization regressions

## What Still Needs Manual Testing

- Actual AI inference (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI)
- Real geocoding (OpenStreetMap API)
- End-to-end workflow on UNC paths

## Next Steps

- Monitor GitHub Actions for green checks on all pushes/PRs
- Optionally add ruff/flake8/mypy for stricter lint/type checks
- Optionally tune workflow triggers for speed or cost
