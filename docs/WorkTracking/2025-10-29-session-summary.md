# 2025-10-29 Session Summary

## Status
- User reports: "runs are happening" â€” builds/tests are in progress.
- We simplified the viewer (always uses descriptions file), added source file tracking for video frames, and updated parsers yesterday (see 2025-10-28 summary).

### Incoming build test run (for verification)
- Workflow path: \\qnap\home\idt\descriptions\wf_BuildTest_ollama_moondreamlatest_concise_20251029_024146
- Contents: ~25 recent photos from Europe with geocoding enabled
- Purpose: Validate viewer simplification and source tracking end-to-end

## What to verify in this build
- Viewer reads only `descriptions/image_descriptions.txt` and shows full description text (no "strong strong").
- Window title shows "XX%, X of Y images described" and adds "(Live)" while active.
- Refresh button works and preserves focus/position.
- Descriptions file includes `Source: <video path> at <timestamp>` for extracted frames; absent for still images.
- EXIF on a frame contains ImageDescription/UserComment with source video path and timestamp.
- Combined CSV export includes Location column (city/state/country when available) and remains date sorted.
- All apps build and launch (CLI + GUIs).

## Quick checks (when runs complete)
- Open any recent workflow in viewer and skim descriptions for Source lines.
- Spot-check a frame's EXIF using exiftool or Pillow to confirm source fields.
- Run combined export and check Location column is filled where EXIF has data.

### Optional: automated verification helper
We added `tools/verify_workflow_output.py` to quickly validate a workflow:

```bash
# Summary + list first 5 frames missing Source (if any)
python tools/verify_workflow_output.py "//qnap/home/idt/descriptions/wf_BuildTest_ollama_moondreamlatest_concise_20251029_024146" --list-missing 5

# Include EXIF spot-checks (up to 5 images)
python tools/verify_workflow_output.py "//qnap/home/idt/descriptions/wf_BuildTest_ollama_moondreamlatest_concise_20251029_024146" --check-exif --list-missing 5
```

It reports counts for entries with Source lines, OSM attribution (geocoded), Photo Date, Camera, and flags likely video frames missing Source.

## Notes / Decisions
- Viewer simplification removed HTML parsing path entirely to improve accessibility and reliability.
- Source tracking is embedded in EXIF and echoed into the descriptions file for easy tracing back to originals.

## Next
- Ask Kelly how the build and run went and capture results here.
- If any failures, triage with minimal repro and add tests.
