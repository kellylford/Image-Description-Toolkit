# Session Summary: October 31, 2025

## Status: In Progress — Build/install cycle completed, investigating config argument behavior

Branch: feature/explicit-config-arguments

This session focused on three main areas: workflow UX improvements (making the hidden "prepare" copy phase visible), adding session-scoped prompt configuration override to the ImageDescriber GUI, and fixing packaging/installer issues. After a full rebuild and install cycle, investigating `--config-id` argument behavior.

---

## Changes made

### Workflow UX
- Prepare/copy phase progress: Added visible progress updates (X/N, Y%) while copying images to the temp workspace before description begins.
- Status integration: Writes periodic updates to status.log and prints to console so UNC/slow-disk operations are obviously progressing.

### ImageDescriber GUI
- File menu: Added “Load Prompt Config…” to select an image_describer_config.json focused on prompts only.
- Session-scoped state: New attribute on the main window to hold a selected prompt config path for the current session (no persistence yet).
- Dialogs/workers: Passed prompt_config_path into ProcessingDialog and ProcessingWorker. Both now prefer the explicit path when present, then fall back to standard locations.
- Prompt resolution: If the provided JSON has either prompts or prompt_variations, normalize to a ‘prompts’ map and populate the lists accordingly, including the video processing dialog.
- Crash fix: Removed setAccessibleName/setAccessibleDescription on QAction (unsupported). Replaced with setWhatsThis/statusTip. Also fixed a stray indentation bug in the QAction setup that caused a syntax error.

### Issues logged
- #63 — Add custom config file support to ImageDescriber GUI (enhancement) — implemented minimally for prompts this session.
- #64 — Add default input/output directory support to workflow_config.json (enhancement) — tracked for follow-up, not implemented today.

---

## Technical decisions and rationale
- Scope-limited override: We constrain the GUI override to prompt content to avoid cross-cutting model/provider changes mid-session. This keeps failure modes narrow and UX predictable.
- Non-persistent, session-only: Avoids introducing new onboarding or user settings complexity; we can add persistence after validation.
- Normalization: Accept both legacy prompt_variations and prompts keys, normalize to prompts dict so downstream UI can bind consistently.
- Accessibility: Follow WCAG 2.2 AA; QActions don’t support accessible names/descriptions, so we use What’s This and status tips while keeping accessible names on regular widgets.

---

## Testing results
- Static checks: Resolved a Python indentation error in imagedescriber.py related to the new menu action. Re-ran error checks — PASS (no syntax errors).
- Runtime sanity: Verified menu appears, file chooser opens, and prompt_config_path is propagated to dialogs/workers. Pre-existing unresolved import warnings are unrelated to these changes and remain unchanged.
- Workflow progress: Confirmed copy-phase progress messages appear in console and status log in a dry run scenario; end-to-end timing validation on large UNC directories still pending.

What we could not fully verify in this session:
- Frozen executable behavior for the new GUI prompt loading and the prepare-phase progress in idt.exe; build/install time wasn’t part of this iteration. Will verify in next build cycle.

---

## Affected files (high level)
- imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py — Added menu action, session state, dialog/worker wiring; fixed QAction accessibility and an indentation bug.
- imagedescriber/worker_threads.py — ProcessingWorker accepts prompt_config_path and normalizes prompt config to a prompts map.
- workflow.py — Added “prepare” phase progress and status logging during copy.
- docs/worktracking/ISSUE_ImageDescriber_Custom_Config_Support.md — Reference doc for the GUI config enhancement.
- docs/worktracking/ISSUE_Workflow_Default_Directories_Config.md — Enhancement spec for default directories.

Note: The compile-error fix applied in this session corrected the mis-indented setWhatsThis() call for the “Load Prompt Config…” QAction.

---

## User-facing summary
- Workflow no longer appears “stuck” during the pre-describe copy phase; you’ll see clear progress updates and percentages.
- In the ImageDescriber app, you can now load a prompt config JSON for this session from File > Load Prompt Config…; the prompts in dialogs will update accordingly.
- A crash introduced by adding the new menu was fixed; the app should run normally again.

---

## Next steps
1. Build and smoke-test frozen executables (imagedescriber.exe, idt.exe) to validate prompt-file loading and prepare-phase progress in production mode.
2. Optional UX: Refresh open dialogs automatically when a new prompt config is loaded.
3. Optional persistence: Remember last-used prompt config (per user or per workspace).
4. Broader workflow tests on large UNC directories to validate progress timing and UI responsiveness end-to-end.

---

## Quality gates
- Build: PASS (source-level; executables not built this session)
- Lint/Typecheck: PASS for changed files (no syntax errors detected)
- Tests: N/A this session — targeted runtime validation only; will expand with GUI automation or smoke tests in the next cycle.

---

## Session log
- Implemented GUI “Load Prompt Config…” and session-scoped prompt override.
- Propagated prompt_config_path through dialogs/workers and normalized prompt configs.
- Fixed QAction misuse and indentation error in imagedescriber.py.
- Added visible prepare/copy phase progress to workflow and integrated status updates.
- Logged two follow-up enhancements (#63, #64).
