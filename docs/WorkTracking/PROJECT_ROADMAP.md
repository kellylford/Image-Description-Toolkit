# Image Description Toolkit - Project Roadmap

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Current Focus:** Simplification and Release Preparation

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive testing with multiple AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, ONNX, HuggingFace, GroundingDINO, YOLO), we've identified that the **core narrative description functionality** is what provides the most value. The object detection and NPU-based approaches, while technically interesting, add significant installation complexity without proportional benefit to description quality.

**Key Decision:** Simplify to three proven cloud/local providers (Claude, Ollama, OpenAI) + prepare for Gemini, then focus on packaging and release.

---

## Strategic Observations

### What Works Well
1. ‚úÖ **Narrative descriptions** from Claude, Ollama, OpenAI are excellent quality
2. ‚úÖ **Workflow system** (import, resume, batch processing) is solid
3. ‚úÖ **ImageDescriber GUI** is functional and actively used
4. ‚úÖ **Video frame extraction** and **HEIC conversion** work reliably
5. ‚úÖ **HTML gallery generation** provides good visualization
6. ‚úÖ **Multi-provider comparison** tools (combine_workflow_descriptions.py) are valuable

### What Adds Complexity Without Proportional Value
1. ‚ùå **ONNX models** - Installation complexity, limited narrative capability
2. ‚ùå **HuggingFace models** - Large downloads, variable quality, setup issues
3. ‚ùå **GroundingDINO** - Object detection useful but not for narrative descriptions
4. ‚ùå **YOLO integration** - Similar to GroundingDINO - specialized use case
5. ‚ùå **Copilot+ NPU** - Great concept but not ready for narrative descriptions yet

### The Core Problem with Object Detection
Object detection **reduces description quality** when used as a pre-filter:
- Ollama/Claude/OpenAI can describe items the detector missed
- Passing only detected objects limits the narrative scope
- The AI models already "see" the full image - why pre-filter?

**Conclusion:** Object detection has value for specialized tasks (counting, locating, filtering) but should NOT be in the primary narrative description workflow.

## Project Phases (Ordered)

### Phase 1: Model Removal & Simplification ‚è≥ CURRENT
**Goal:** Remove ONNX, HuggingFace, GroundingDINO, YOLO, Copilot+ from codebase  
**Outcome:** Clean codebase with Claude, Ollama, OpenAI only  
**Status:** Planning complete, awaiting approval

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation üìã NEXT
**Goal:** Comprehensive testing of remaining providers  
**Tests:**
- Workflow scripts (video, convert, describe, html)
- ImageDescriber GUI (all tabs, import, resume)
- Batch processing with all three providers
- Edge cases (interruption, resume, large batches)

### Phase 3: Add Google Gemini üÜï PENDING API KEY
**Goal:** Integrate fourth proven provider  
**Requirements:** Google API key from user  
**Approach:** Use Claude integration as template

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes üêõ ONGOING
**Goal:** Fix issues discovered in testing  
**Priority:** Critical bugs blocking usage

### Phase 5: Packaging & Distribution üì¶ FUTURE
**Goal:** Release as executable/installable package  
**Options:**
- PyInstaller for standalone executable
- Python wheel/pip package
- Docker container
- Conda package

### Phase 6: Documentation Rewrite üìù FUTURE
**Goal:** Complete documentation refresh based on simplified codebase  
**Scope:**
- User guides for Claude/Ollama/OpenAI/Gemini
- Installation guide (simplified)
- Workflow examples
- Batch file templates
- Troubleshooting

### Phase 7: Release üöÄ FUTURE
**Goal:** Public release with simplified feature set  
**Version:** 2.0.0 (major version for breaking changes)

### Phase 8: Model Management Refactoring üîß FUTURE
**Goal:** Simplify model detection to < 5 steps  
**Current:** 20+ step process across multiple files  
**Target:** Centralized registry pattern with auto-detection

### Phase 9: Metadata Support üíæ FUTURE
**Goal:** Preserve and manage image metadata across workflow  
**Features:**
- EXIF preservation
- Description metadata embedding
- Cross-tool metadata sync

## Feedback on Proposed Plan

### ‚úÖ Excellent Decisions

1. **Simplification First** - Removing complexity before release is the right move
2. **Testing Before Adding** - Validating current functionality before Gemini is smart
3. **Packaging Focus** - Making it easy to install/use is critical for adoption
4. **Documentation Last** - Documenting the final state prevents rework
5. **Metadata as Future Work** - Nice-to-have but not blocking release

### üí° Suggested Refinements

#### Phase 2 (Testing)
- Consider creating automated test suite
- Document test cases in worktracking folder
- Create testing checklist for manual validation

#### Phase 5 (Packaging)
**Recommendation:** Start with **PyInstaller** for simplicity
- Creates standalone .exe (Windows) or binary (Mac/Linux)
- Users don't need Python installed
- Can bundle dependencies
- Relatively simple to maintain

**Pros:**
- One-click installation
- No dependency management for users
- Works on systems without Python

**Cons:**
- Large file size (~200-500MB)
- Still need Ollama installed separately (for local models)
- API keys still need manual setup

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Python Wheel** - For Python users, simpler but requires Python
2. **Docker** - Great for reproducibility, harder for non-technical users
3. **Conda** - Best for data science users, requires Conda ecosystem

**My Recommendation:** PyInstaller + clear documentation for Ollama installation

#### Phase 8 (Model Management)
**Critical Success Factor:** This is where future extensibility lives
- Consider provider plugin architecture
- Auto-discovery of models
- Centralized capability matrix
- Single registration point for new providers

### üéØ Priority Adjustments

**Consider moving up:**
- Basic automated testing (Phase 2) - prevents regression
- Packaging exploration (Phase 5) - might reveal issues early

**Consider deferring:**
- Metadata support (Phase 9) - significant scope, low urgency

## Notes for Implementation

### When Removing Models
1. **Be systematic** - Use the checklist from Claude integration (reversed)
2. **Test after each provider removal** - Don't remove all at once
3. **Keep commits separate** - One provider per commit for easy rollback
4. **Check imports** - Many files import these providers
5. **Update batch files** - BatForScripts directory has examples

### For Packaging
1. **Start simple** - Basic PyInstaller first
2. **Test on clean machine** - Critical for validating dependencies
3. **Document installer creation** - So it can be repeated
4. **Consider size** - Look for ways to reduce package size

### For Documentation
1. **Screenshots** - Updated for simplified interface
2. **Quick start** - 5 minutes to first description
3. **Examples** - Real-world use cases
4. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Open Questions

1. **Should we keep object detection as optional/advanced feature?**
   - Pros: Some users may want it
   - Cons: Adds complexity, maintenance burden
   - Recommendation: Remove for 2.0, consider plugin for 2.1+

2. **What about users who installed ONNX/HuggingFace?**
   - Migration guide in documentation
   - Clear communication about removed features
   - Explain benefits of simplification

3. **Ollama Cloud models?**
   - Keep or remove alongside ONNX/HF?
   - Recommendation: Keep - it's just an Ollama variant, minimal complexity

4. **Version numbering for release?**
   - 2.0.0 (breaking changes)
   - Or 1.0.0 (first "real" release)
   - Recommendation: 2.0.0 to signal major refactoring

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** - Get user feedback/approval
2. **Create removal plan** - Detailed checklist (separate document)
3. **Begin Phase 1** - Start removing models systematically
4. **Daily check-ins** - Brief status updates during active phases
