# Batch UI Removal Changes - October 14, 2025

## Overview
Removed batch processing UI elements from ImageDescriber to discourage marking dozens of files for batch processing. Users can still process multiple images using the "Process All" command.

## UI Elements Removed

### 1. File Header and Documentation
- **File:** `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py`
- **Lines 4-14:** Removed references to batch processing in file header comments
- **Lines 9193-9210:** Updated About dialog - changed "Batch processing" to "Multiple image processing"

### 2. Menu Items (Process Menu)
- **Lines 4735-4755:** Removed three menu actions:
  - "Mark for Batch" (Ctrl+B)
  - "Process Batch" (Ctrl+Shift+B)
  - "Clear Batch Processing"

### 3. Filter Menu (View Menu)
- **Lines 4876-4879:** Removed "Show Batch Items Only" filter action
- **Lines 5227-5237:** Removed "batch" from filter_display dictionary in update_window_title()

### 4. Visual Indicators
- **Lines 5918-5921:** Removed batch prefix indicator ("b") from tree/flat view display names
- **Lines 5954-5956:** Removed light blue background color for batch-marked items in tree/flat view
- **Lines 6009-6011:** Removed light blue background color for batch-marked video frames
- **Lines 6145-6148:** Removed light blue background color for batch-marked items in flat view (descriptions)
- **Lines 6252-6254:** Removed batch indicator from accessibility description in master-detail view

### 5. UI Labels
- **Lines 4291-4292:** Removed batch_label widget from tree view layout
- **Lines 4354-4355:** Removed batch_label_md widget from master-detail view layout

### 6. Accessible Descriptions
- **Line 4284:** Removed "B to mark for batch" from tree view accessible description

### 7. Filter Logic
- **Lines 5880:** Removed batch filter check from refresh_tree_view()
- **Lines 6086:** Removed batch filter check from refresh_flat_view()
- **Lines 6206-6207:** Removed batch filter check from refresh_master_detail_view()
- **Line 8283:** Removed filter_batch_action.setChecked() from set_filter()

### 8. Method Calls
- **Line 5287:** Removed update_batch_label() call from new_workspace()
- **Line 6040:** Removed update_batch_label() call from refresh_tree_view()
- **Line 6157:** Removed update_batch_label() call from refresh_flat_view()
- **Line 6272:** Removed update_batch_label() call from refresh_master_detail_view()

## Data Structures Preserved (Backward Compatibility)

The following internal data structures and methods were kept to maintain compatibility with existing workspace files that may have batch_marked flags set:

### WorkspaceItem Class
- `batch_marked: bool = False` (line 491)
- Serialization includes batch_marked (lines 507, 517)

### ImageDescriber Class Variables
- `batch_queue: List[str] = []` (line 4208)
- `batch_total: int = 0` (line 4213)
- `batch_completed: int = 0` (line 4214)
- `batch_processing: bool = False` (line 4215)

### Methods Kept But Not Called
- `update_batch_label()` (lines 6155-6161)
- `clear_batch_selection()` (lines 6402-6407)
- `show_batch_completion_dialog()` (lines 6409-6428)
- `toggle_batch_mark()` (lines 7122-7143)
- `process_batch()` (lines 7145+)

### Internal State Management
- batch_queue.clear() calls in workspace operations (lines 5281, 5310)
- Batch processing state reset on stop (lines 6916-6920)
- Batch tracking in process_all_images() (lines 8651-8678)

## Impact

### User-Facing Changes
1. **No batch marking UI:** Users cannot mark individual items for batch processing via UI
2. **No batch filter:** "Show Batch Items Only" filter removed from View menu
3. **No visual batch indicators:** No "b" prefix or blue background for batch items
4. **No batch menu items:** All batch-related commands removed from Process menu
5. **Updated about dialog:** More accurate feature description

### No Impact On
1. **Process All command:** Still works normally for processing multiple images
2. **Existing workspaces:** Files with batch_marked flags will load without errors
3. **Internal processing:** Batch tracking still works for "Process All" operations
4. **Data integrity:** All workspace files remain fully compatible

## Testing Required

1. **Visual verification:** Confirm no batch UI elements appear
2. **Menu verification:** Confirm batch menu items and filters removed
3. **Accessibility testing:** Verify screen readers don't announce batch status
4. **Workspace loading:** Test loading old workspace files with batch_marked items
5. **Process All:** Verify "Process All" command still works correctly
6. **About dialog:** Verify updated text displays correctly

## Files Modified

- `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` - Main application file (multiple sections)

## Commit Message Suggestion

```
Remove batch processing UI from ImageDescriber

- Removed all batch-related menu items, filters, and visual indicators
- Updated About dialog to reflect accurate feature set
- Kept internal data structures for backward compatibility with existing workspaces
- Users can still process multiple images using "Process All" command
- Addresses concern about encouraging users to mark dozens of files

This simplifies the UI while maintaining full functionality for processing
multiple images and preserving compatibility with existing workspace files.
