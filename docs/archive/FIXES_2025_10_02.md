### 1. Ollama Models and Object Detection

**Q: Do the ollama models not do object detection or is it just that Copilot hardware is faster?**

**A: Ollama models DO NOT do native object detection.** Here's the breakdown:

#### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Technology | Object Detection |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **ollama** | Pure LLM (llava, gemma3, etc.) | ❌ No - Vision understanding only |
| **onnx** | YOLO + Ollama Hybrid | ✅ Yes - YOLO detects, Ollama describes |
| **object_detection** | Pure YOLO | ✅ Yes - Only detection, no descriptions |
| **copilot** | Windows AI APIs | ❌ No - LLM-based vision (faster on NPU hardware) |
| **openai** | GPT-4 Vision | ❌ No - Vision understanding only |
| **huggingface** | Local transformers | ❌ No - Vision understanding only |

#### What Each Does

**Pure LLM Vision (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)**:
- Understand and describe what they "see"
- Trained on massive datasets with image-text pairs
- Great at context, nuance, artistic content, complex scenes
- **Cannot** provide bounding boxes or precise object counts
- Think: "A painting shows three people sitting at a table..."

**Object Detection (YOLO)**:
- Detect specific objects with bounding boxes
- Trained on COCO dataset (80 everyday object classes)
- Provides: object name, confidence %, location, size
- **Cannot** understand context or artistic meaning
- Think: "person (85%, large, middle-center), chair (72%, medium, bottom-left)"

**Hybrid (Enhanced ONNX)**:
1. YOLO detects objects first → "3 people, 1 table, 4 chairs"
2. Passes detection data + image to Ollama
3. Ollama creates enhanced description using both vision AND detection data
4. Result: "The image shows three people (detected with high confidence) sitting around a wooden table..."

**Copilot+ PC**:
- Uses Windows AI Platform APIs
- Hardware acceleration via NPU (Neural Processing Unit)
- Still LLM-based vision, just **faster** on Copilot+ hardware
- 40+ TOPS NPU enables real-time processing

#### Performance Comparison

On typical hardware:
- **Ollama (CPU)**: 30-60 seconds per image
- **Ollama (GPU)**: 5-15 seconds per image
- **YOLO**: 1-3 seconds per image (very fast!)
- **Copilot+ (NPU)**: 3-8 seconds per image (hardware accelerated)

### 2. Object Detection Provider Not Showing Up

**Q: Object detection didn't show up on a different computer. Did I likely need to install something?**

**A: Yes, you need to install `ultralytics` (YOLO).**

#### Why It's Missing

The `object_detection` provider checks at startup:
```python
try:
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    self.yolo_available = True
except ImportError:
    self.yolo_available = False
    # Provider won't appear in the list
```

If the import fails, the provider is hidden from the UI.

#### How to Fix

On the other computer, run:
```bash
# Install all dependencies (recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install just YOLO
pip install ultralytics

# For Python 3.13 users
pip install -r requirements-python313.txt
```

#### What Gets Installed

`ultralytics` package includes:
- YOLOv8 architecture (n, s, m, l, x variants)
- Auto-downloads models on first use (~6MB for n, ~138MB for x)
- COCO class definitions (80 objects)
- Inference engine and utilities

#### Verification

After installation, restart ImageDescriber. The provider should appear as:
- "Object Detection" in the provider dropdown
- With model choices: Object Detection Only, Spatial Detection, Detailed Analysis, Debug Mode

### 3. Image Preview Accessible Name

**Q: The accessible name should be the file name or whatever the user named it.**

**A: ✅ Fixed!** The preview now uses the custom display name or filename.

#### What Was Changed

**Before**:
```python
# Static, unhelpful accessible name
self.image_preview_label.setAccessibleName("Image Preview")
```

**After**:
```python
# Dynamic, informative accessible name
def _update_preview_accessible_name(self, file_path: str):
    workspace_item = self.workspace.get_item(file_path)
    if workspace_item and workspace_item.display_name:
        display_name = workspace_item.display_name
    else:
        display_name = Path(file_path).name
    
    self.image_preview_label.setAccessibleName(f"Image Preview: {display_name}")
    self.image_preview_label.setAccessibleDescription(
        f"Preview of {display_name}. Press Enter for fullscreen, Escape to exit."
    )
```

#### What Screen Readers Now Announce

**With custom name**:
- "Image Preview: Beach Sunset at Golden Hour"
- Description: "Preview of Beach Sunset at Golden Hour. Press Enter for fullscreen..."

**Without custom name**:
- "Image Preview: IMG_1234.jpg"
- Description: "Preview of IMG_1234.jpg. Press Enter for fullscreen..."

#### Benefits

- ✅ More informative for screen reader users
- ✅ Uses custom display names when available
- ✅ Falls back gracefully to filename
- ✅ Updates dynamically as images change
- ✅ Includes usage hints in description

### 4. Renaming Chat Sessions

**Q: Trying to rename chats fails with an error about not finding the image.**

**A: ✅ Fixed!** Chat sessions are now handled separately from image files.

#### What Was Wrong

The `rename_item()` function tried to treat everything as a file:
```python
# This failed for chat sessions
item = self.workspace.get_item(file_path)  # file_path is actually a chat_id!
current_name = Path(file_path).name  # Error: chat_id isn't a file path
```

Chat sessions don't have file paths - they're stored in `workspace.chat_sessions` dictionary.

#### The Fix

Now detects item type first:
```python
def rename_item(self):
    # Check if this is a chat session
    item_type = current_item.data(Qt.ItemDataRole.UserRole + 1)
    
    if item_type == "chat_session":
        # Handle chat rename
        chat_id = current_item.data(Qt.ItemDataRole.UserRole)
        chat_session = self.workspace.chat_sessions[chat_id]
        current_name = chat_session.get('name', 'Unnamed Chat')
        # ... show rename dialog for chat
    else:
        # Handle regular image/file rename
        file_path = self.get_current_selected_file_path()
        # ... show rename dialog for file
```

#### How It Works Now

**Chat Sessions**:
1. Detects it's a chat (via `UserRole + 1` = "chat_session")
2. Gets chat ID instead of file path
3. Looks up chat in `workspace.chat_sessions`
4. Renames the `name` field in chat data
5. Refreshes view to show new name

**Image Files**:
1. Detects it's a regular item
2. Gets file path normally
3. Looks up in `workspace.items`
4. Renames the `display_name` field
5. Refreshes view to show new name

#### Benefits

- ✅ No more errors when renaming chats
- ✅ Chat names persist across sessions
- ✅ Image renames still work as before
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ More robust error handling
