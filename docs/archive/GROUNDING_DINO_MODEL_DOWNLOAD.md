## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need to download the model manually?**  
A: No! It downloads automatically when you first use GroundingDINO.

**Q: Can I use it offline?**  
A: Yes, after the first download, everything works offline.

**Q: What if the download fails?**  
A: Check your internet connection and try again. The download will resume from where it left off.

**Q: Can I delete the model to save space?**  
A: Yes, delete the `~/.cache/groundingdino/` folder. It will re-download next time you use it.

**Q: Why is the first detection slow?**
