# Archived Documentation - v4.1.0 Release

**Archive Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Reason:** wxPython GUI migration complete, PyQt6 documentation no longer relevant  
**Status:** Retained for historical reference only

## 🗂️ Archived Files

### PyQt6 Architecture Documentation
- `ORIGINAL_QT6_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Original PyQt6 ImageDescriber architecture (removed Jan 8, 2026)
- `QT6_VS_WXPYTHON_COMPARISON.md` - Framework comparison document (historical reference)

**Note:** These documents describe the PyQt6 GUI architecture that was replaced with wxPython in v4.1.0. The code is no longer in the repository but preserved here for historical understanding.

## 📝 Why These Were Archived

**wxPython Migration (v4.1.0):**
- All GUI applications migrated from PyQt6 to wxPython
- Improved cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS)
- Better accessibility support (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Original architecture no longer applicable

**Repository Cleanup:**
- Legacy documentation no longer needed for development
- Archived for historical reference and understanding
- Current documentation in `docs/` directory is definitive
