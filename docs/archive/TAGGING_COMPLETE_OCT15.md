# Tagging and Branch Setup - October 15, 2025

## ✅ All Three Steps Complete!

---

## Step 1: ✅ Tagged Main Branch as Stable CLI

**Tag:** `v1.1.0-cli`  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Commit:** `460b459` (current HEAD of main)  
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub

**Purpose:** Preserves the known-good state of CLI tools without ImageDescriber GUI.

**What's included:**
- idt CLI tool
- Python scripts (workflow.py, etc.)
- Basic viewer and prompt editor
- Batch helpers
- Core workflow utilities

**Message:**
> "Stable CLI tools version - Command-line interface tools for image description workflows. This is the CLI-only version without the ImageDescriber GUI."

---

## Step 2: ✅ Tagged ImageDescriber as Likely v2.0.0

**Tag:** `v2.0.0-likely`  
**Branch:** `ImageDescriber`  
**Commit:** `7c39bdc` (includes kelly cleanup commit)  
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub

**Purpose:** Captures the current stable state during final testing. This is your "get back to here" safety point.

**What's included:**
- Complete ImageDescriber GUI application
- All build automation and packaging
- Distribution-ready installers
- Architecture simplification
- All user-specific paths removed
- 50+ batch helper scripts
- Analysis and testing tools
- Everything from 256+ commits

**Message:**
> "Likely v2.0.0 Release Candidate - Complete Image Description Toolkit with full GUI and CLI capabilities. This tag captures the current stable state during final testing."

---

## Step 3: ✅ Created Development Branch

**Branch:** `development`  
**Based on:** `ImageDescriber` (at commit `7c39bdc`)  
**Status:** ✅ Created and pushed to GitHub  
**Tracking:** `origin/development` set as upstream

**Purpose:** New development work while ImageDescriber continues testing on multiple machines.

**Current state:** Identical to ImageDescriber at the time of branching.

## Current Repository State

### Tags (3 total):
1. **`v1.0.0`** - Historical tag from Sept 2, 2025 (on main, before split)
2. **`v1.1.0-cli`** - NEW: Stable CLI tools (on main) ⭐
3. **`v2.0.0-likely`** - NEW: Release candidate (on ImageDescriber) ⭐

### Branches (3 active):
1. **`main`** - CLI-only version (tagged as v1.1.0-cli)
2. **`ImageDescriber`** - Testing on multiple machines (tagged as v2.0.0-likely)
3. **`development`** - NEW: Active development branch ⭐

### You are currently on: `development` ✓

## Branch Strategy Moving Forward

```
main (v1.1.0-cli)
  └─ Known good CLI tools
  └─ Source of truth for scripts

ImageDescriber (v2.0.0-likely)
  └─ Testing phase
  └─ Running on multiple machines
  └─ Likely to become v2.0.0

development (just created)
  └─ New feature development
  └─ Experimentation
  └─ Based on ImageDescriber state
```

---

## Recovery Points

If you ever need to get back to specific states:

### Return to CLI-only state:
```bash
git checkout v1.1.0-cli
# or
git checkout main
```

### Return to the "likely v2.0.0" state:
```bash
git checkout v2.0.0-likely
# or
git checkout ImageDescriber  # (currently identical)
```

### Return to pre-development state:
```bash
git checkout ImageDescriber
```

---

## What Happens Next?

### Recommended Workflow:

1. **Active Development** → Use `development` branch
   - Experiment with new features
   - Try new ideas
   - Break things if needed!

2. **Testing** → Monitor `ImageDescriber` branch
   - Continue testing on multiple machines
   - No changes while testing
   - If issues found, fix in `development` then cherry-pick or merge

3. **When Ready to Release v2.0.0:**
   ```bash
   # If ImageDescriber testing is successful:
   git checkout ImageDescriber
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Official v2.0.0 Release"
   git push origin v2.0.0
   
   # Then update main if desired
   ```

4. **If Development Creates Something Good:**
   ```bash
   # Merge development back to ImageDescriber
   git checkout ImageDescriber
   git merge development
   
   # Or create a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature-name development
   ```

---

## Safety Nets in Place

✅ **Main branch preserved** - CLI tools tagged and safe  
✅ **ImageDescriber preserved** - Tagged as v2.0.0-likely  
✅ **Development isolated** - Can experiment without risk  
✅ **All tags pushed to GitHub** - Recoverable from anywhere  

**No matter what happens, you can always return to these tagged states!**

## Commands for Quick Reference

### Switch between branches:
```bash
git checkout main           # CLI-only version
git checkout ImageDescriber # Testing version
git checkout development    # Active development
```

### See all tags:
```bash
git tag -l
```

### See tag details:
```bash
git show v2.0.0-likely
git show v1.1.0-cli
```

### Create release from tag on GitHub:
1. Go to: https://github.com/kellylford/Image-Description-Toolkit/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select tag: `v2.0.0-likely` (or `v1.1.0-cli`)
4. Add release notes
5. Upload distribution ZIP files
6. Publish!

## Testing Phase Notes

**Current Status:**
- ImageDescriber is "working amazingly well" ✨
- Testing on multiple machines with external installation
- Installing the way end users will
- Giving it time to "bake" before final v2.0.0 release

**What You're Watching For:**
- Any huge issues during testing
- Real-world installation problems
- Multi-machine stability
- User experience validation

**When Testing Completes:**
- If all good → Tag as official `v2.0.0`
- If issues found → Fix in `development`, test, then release
- Either way → `v2.0.0-likely` tag preserves this exact state

---

## Summary

✅ **Step 1 Complete:** Main tagged as `v1.1.0-cli` (CLI stable)  
✅ **Step 2 Complete:** Current state tagged as `v2.0.0-likely` (safety point)  
✅ **Step 3 Complete:** Development branch created (new work area)  

**You're all set!** You now have:
- A stable CLI version preserved
- The current release candidate tagged and safe
- A clean development branch for new ideas
- Multiple safety nets to return to any state

Happy developing on the `development` branch! 🚀
