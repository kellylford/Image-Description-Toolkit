# Viewer Enhancements - October 16, 2025

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Branch**: ImageDescriber  
**Status**: Completed and Committed

---

## Summary

Major enhancements to the Image Description Viewer focusing on accessibility, workflow browsing, and information display. All changes improve user experience while maintaining WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Browse Results Feature

**Purpose**: Allow users to easily browse and select from available workflow results without navigating the file system.

**Implementation**:
- Added "Browse Results" button to main viewer UI
- Auto-detects workflow directories in common locations:
  - `<installation_dir>/Descriptions/`
  - `../Descriptions/` (one level up)
  - `C:/idt/Descriptions` (common Windows path)
- Displays workflows in a single-column list (QListWidget)
- Combined format: `Name | Prompt | Images | Model | Provider | Timestamp`
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys to browse, Enter to select
- Manual fallback: "Browse Directory" button

**Benefits**:
- No need to remember workflow directory paths
- See workflow metadata at a glance
- Keyboard-driven for efficiency
- Single tab stop for better accessibility

**Commits**:
- `071ebfd` - Initial Browse Results feature
- `43600f5` - Convert table to list for accessibility
- `285dde9` - Fix missing QListWidgetItem import
- `1d3ec70` - Reorder columns and format dates

---

### 2. Accessibility Improvements

**Purpose**: Reduce tab stops and improve screen reader experience.

**Changes Made**:

#### Workflow Browser Dialog
- **Before**: QTableWidget with 6 columns = 6 tab stops
- **After**: QListWidget with combined text = 1 tab stop
- All workflow data in single string per item
- Full accessible text for screen readers
- Arrow key navigation between workflows

#### Column Order Optimization
Put most important information first:
1. **Name** - Workflow name
2. **Prompt** - Prompt style
3. **Images** - Description count
4. **Model** - AI model
5. **Provider** - AI provider
6. **Timestamp** - Date/time

**Example Entry**:
```
promptbaseline | Simple | 64 images | qwen3-vl_235b-cloud | ollama | 10/16/2025 7:46A
```

**Commits**:
- `43600f5` - Table to list conversion
- `1d3ec70` - Column reordering

---

### 3. Date/Time Formatting

**Purpose**: Use human-friendly, concise date/time format.

**Format**: `M/D/YYYY H:MMP`
- No leading zeros on month/day/hour
- 12-hour time with A/P suffix
- Examples:
  - `3/24/2025 7:35P` (7:35 PM)
  - `10/16/2025 8:03A` (8:03 AM)
  - `12/1/2025 12:15P` (12:15 PM noon)

**Applied To**:
- Workflow browser timestamp column
- Image dates in description view

**Commits**:
- `1d3ec70` - Workflow browser dates
- `9560207` - Image description dates

---

### 4. Live Mode Title Enhancement

**Purpose**: Show progress information more clearly in window title.

**Format Changes**:

**Before**:
```
Image Description Viewer - Processing: 50 of 150 images (Live)
```

**After**:
```
Image Description Viewer - 33%, 50 of 150 images described (Live)
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Percentage shown first (no decimals)
- Completed count before total
- Changed "images" to "images described"
- Easier to see progress at a glance

**Commits**:
- `43600f5` - Title format change

---

### 5. Always Show Statistics

**Purpose**: Display workflow size and completion info in all modes, not just live mode.

**Title Format Examples**:

1. **HTML Mode (Completed)**:
   ```
   Image Description Viewer - 100%, 64 of 64 images described
   ```

2. **With Workflow Name**:
   ```
   Image Description Viewer - promptbaseline - 100%, 64 of 64 images described
   ```

3. **Live Mode (In Progress)**:
   ```
   Image Description Viewer - bigdaddyrun - 75%, 810 of 1077 images described (Live)
   ```

4. **Live Mode (Completed)**:
   ```
   Image Description Viewer - bigdaddyrun - 100%, 1077 of 1077 images described
   ```

5. **Empty Viewer**:
   ```
   Image Description Viewer
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Always see workflow size
- Know completion status
- Better context for screen readers
- Easy to compare workflows

**Commits**:
- `c372f4b` - Always show statistics

---

### 6. Image Date Display

**Purpose**: Show when each image was originally taken/created.

**Implementation**:
- Added `get_image_date()` function
- Extracts EXIF date from images
- Priority order:
  1. **DateTimeOriginal** (when photo was taken - preferred)
  2. **DateTimeDigitized** (when photo was digitized)
  3. **DateTime** (EXIF modification date)
  4. **File mtime** (fallback if no EXIF)
- Appends date to end of description with double line break

**Format**: Same as workflow browser - `M/D/YYYY H:MMP`

**Example Display**:
```
This is a vibrant, natural scene centered on a slender waterfall cascading
down a steep, moss-covered rock face in a lush, tropical or subtropical forest.
[... full description ...]

3/25/2025 7:23P
```

**Benefits**:
- Understand image timeline
- Correlate descriptions with events
- Useful for organizing/sorting images
- Preserves original capture date

**Commits**:
- `9560207` - Image date display

## Lessons Learned

### Development Insights

1. **Accessibility First**: Single tab stop significantly improves experience
2. **Reuse Logic**: Importing from list_results.py saved development time
3. **Date Formats Matter**: 12-hour with A/P more readable than 24-hour
4. **Always Show Info**: Users want stats visible at all times, not just live mode
5. **EXIF Priority**: DateTimeOriginal most reliable for "when taken"

### Code Quality

1. **Import Handling**: Try-except for optional imports prevents crashes
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Always provide fallbacks (file mtime for no EXIF)
3. **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable messages for users
4. **Testing**: Manual testing with screen reader essential
5. **Commit Hygiene**: Small, focused commits easier to review and rollback

### User Feedback Integration

- User requested accessibility improvements → Table to list conversion
- User requested date format → Implemented 12-hour with A/P
- User requested always-show stats → Removed live-mode-only restriction
- User requested image dates → Added EXIF extraction

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **EXIF for Video Frames**: Extracted frames don't have original video date
   - Shows frame extraction time, not video recording time
   - Could be enhanced to read video metadata

2. **Date Ambiguity**: Some formats may not parse correctly
   - Rare EXIF formats may fall back to file time
   - Should be fine for 99% of images

3. **No Timezone Info**: Dates shown in local time without timezone
   - EXIF doesn't include timezone
   - Could confuse with international travel photos

4. **Large Workflow Lists**: No pagination
   - 100+ workflows loads fine but scrolling may be tedious
   - Could add virtual scrolling if becomes issue

### None Are Blockers
All limitations are edge cases that don't affect primary functionality.

- ✅ Easier workflow browsing with Browse Results
- ✅ Better accessibility with single-tab navigation
- ✅ More informative with always-visible statistics
- ✅ Enhanced context with image dates
- ✅ Human-friendly date/time formatting

All changes maintain WCAG 2.2 AA compliance and follow the project's accessibility-first philosophy. The viewer is now a more powerful and user-friendly tool for browsing and analyzing image descriptions.
