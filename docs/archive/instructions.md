Follow these guidelines for all coding.

1. Code should be professional quality and tested before calling something complete and ready for submission.
2. Planning and tracking documents should go in the docs/worktracking directory and kept current as work is completed.
3. All coding should be WCAG 2.2 AA conformant. This should be a given for my work so being accessible doesn't need to be highlighted in documentation and such unless it is something especially unique.
4. Work needs to keep in mind that we want to keep support for both the script-based approach for image descriptions and the GUI ImageDescriber app.
5. Avoid the typical behavior of AI of taking shortcuts, not scanning files completely and more. It has already resulted in duplicate code at times and extensive time debugging. The project has become too large for constant testing.
6. Keep a running log of chat conversations in c:\users\kelly\onedrive\VSCodeAIChat.md. Be aware other machines may also edit the file.
