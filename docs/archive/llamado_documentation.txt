LLAMADO.BAT - Ollama Image Batch Processor
==========================================

DESCRIPTION:
A Windows batch script for processing multiple images with Ollama vision models 
to generate descriptions or analyze image content. Recursively processes all 
supported image files in a directory structure.

USAGE:
llamado.bat <model> <image_directory> <prompt>

PARAMETERS:
- model           : The Ollama vision model to use (e.g., llava, llava:13b)
- image_directory : Path to directory containing images (searches recursively)
- prompt          : Text prompt for image analysis

EXAMPLES:
llamado.bat llava "C:\Photos\vacation" "Describe this image in detail"
llamado.bat llava:13b "C:\Screenshots" "What text is visible in this image?"
llamado.bat bakllava "C:\inventory" "How many items are visible in this image?"

SUPPORTED IMAGE FORMATS:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)
- TIFF (.tiff, .tif)

OUTPUT:
Creates "ollama_output.txt" in the current directory containing:
- Processing timestamp and configuration
- Each processed image file path with separators
- Model responses for each image
- Clear formatting for easy reading

FEATURES:
- Recursive directory processing
- Enhanced error messages with usage hints
- Detailed output formatting with timestamps
- Support for additional image formats (WebP, TIFF)
- Progress indicators during processing

PREREQUISITES:
- Ollama must be installed and running
- Vision-capable model must be available (e.g., llava, llava:13b, bakllava)
- Images must be in supported formats

NOTES:
- Processing time varies by model size and image complexity
- Larger models provide more detailed responses but take longer
- Script continues processing even if individual images fail
- Output file is created in the script's current working directory

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "Model name required" - Ensure all three parameters are provided
- No output - Check Ollama is running and model is installed
- Images not found - Verify directory path and supported file formats exist
