  - [ ] USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md
  - [ ] WHATS_INCLUDED.txt
  - [ ] setup_imagedescriber.bat

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Not Bundle Everything?
1. **Size**: Ollama models are 2-8GB each
2. **Flexibility**: Users may already have Ollama installed
3. **Choice**: Not everyone needs all providers
4. **Updates**: External components update independently
5. **Legal**: Some models have separate licenses

### Why This Approach Works
1. **Core app works immediately** - No frustration, instant gratification
2. **Clear documentation** - Users know exactly what to do
3. **Automated setup** - `setup_imagedescriber.bat` handles complexity
4. **Graduated complexity** - Start simple, add features as needed
5. **Turn-key when needed** - Full AI setup in 2-10 minutes

## 🎨 Recommended Distribution Approaches

### Approach 1: Minimal Package (Fastest Download)
**Contents**: Just ImageDescriber.exe + documentation  
**Size**: ~50 MB  
**User setup time**: 10 minutes (if they want AI)  
**Best for**: Most users, fastest distribution

### Approach 2: Ollama Bundle (Most Common Setup)
**Contents**: ImageDescriber.exe + Ollama installer + docs  
**Size**: ~300 MB  
**User setup time**: 5 minutes (run installers)  
**Best for**: Users who want AI but prefer single download

### Approach 3: Full Package (Everything Pre-downloaded)
**Contents**: ImageDescriber.exe + Ollama + models + docs  
**Size**: ~5 GB  
**User setup time**: 2 minutes (run setup script)  
**Best for**: Corporate/institutional deployment, limited internet

**Recommendation**: Use **Approach 1** (minimal) for public releases. Users who want AI can quickly download Ollama via the setup assistant.
