# ImageDescriber Current Status
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Status**: Major accessibility improvements completed - List widget implementation working

## üéØ Latest Achievements

### Major Accessibility Overhaul (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Date**: September 8, 2025
**Goal**: Replace problematic tree widgets with accessible list widgets for better screen reader support

#### What Was Implemented
1. **QTreeWidget ‚Üí QListWidget Conversion**: Replaced both image tree and description tree with flat list widgets
2. **Visual Hierarchy Maintained**: Used indentation with `‚îî‚îÄ` characters to show video frames under parent videos
3. **Master-Detail View Hidden**: Removed menu option (code preserved) to focus users on accessible tree view
4. **Emoji Visual Indicators**: Added üé¨ (video), üìù (has descriptions), üñºÔ∏è (image), ‚è≥ (processing), ‚úì (batch marked)
5. **Complete Method Updates**: Updated all selection handling, data access, and UI refresh methods
6. **Preserved All Functionality**: Batch processing, descriptions, video frame extraction, etc. all maintained

#### Accessibility Benefits
- **Linear Navigation**: Screen readers can navigate through flat list linearly
- **Clear State Information**: Each item announces its type, status, and description count
- **No Expand/Collapse Complexity**: Eliminates confusing tree navigation for screen readers
- **Preserved Visual Structure**: Frames still appear logically under parent videos

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Features

### 1. Accessibility Improvements (WORKING)
- **Custom AccessibleTreeWidget**: Replaces problematic QTreeWidget with screen reader support
- **Custom AccessibleNumericInput**: Replaces QSpinBox/QDoubleSpinBox with accessible QLineEdit + validation
- **Custom AccessibleTextEdit**: Fixed Tab key behavior (moves focus instead of inserting tabs)
- **Dynamic Announcements**: Screen reader announces items as they're added/processed
- **Preserved Business Logic**: All existing functionality maintained

### 2. Window Title Filter Status (WORKING)
- Shows current filter in title bar: `[All] - ImageDescriber` or `[Described] - ImageDescriber`
- Updates automatically when filter changes
- Includes batch processing status: `[Batch: 3/10] - ImageDescriber`

### 3. New Workspace Bug Fix (WORKING)
- Modified `ImageWorkspace.__init__(new_workspace=False)` parameter
- New workspaces start with `saved=True` to prevent endless unsaved changes warnings
- Properly integrated with File ‚Üí New Workspace functionality

### 4. Manual Description Feature (WORKING)
- **Add Manual Description**: New option in Descriptions menu
- **User Input**: Multi-line dialog for entering custom descriptions
- **Integration**: Manual descriptions appear in tree view with "manual manual: [text]" format
- **Workflow**: Select image ‚Üí Descriptions ‚Üí Add Manual Description ‚Üí Enter text
- **Auto-selection**: Newly added descriptions are automatically selected for viewing

## üîß Process All Implementation Status

### Current Implementation Approach
Attempted to create comprehensive processing with live updates by:
1. **HEIC Conversion**: Using existing `scripts/ConvertImage.py` functionality
2. **Video Frame Extraction**: Using existing `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` functionality  
3. **Sequential Processing**: Process images one by one with immediate UI updates
4. **Live Feedback**: Update tree view and descriptions as each item completes

### Key Methods Implemented
- `_start_comprehensive_processing()`: Main orchestrator
- `_process_images_with_live_updates()`: Sequential processing with UI updates
- `_extract_video_frames_with_defaults()`: Auto frame extraction (5-second intervals)
- `convert_heic_files()`: HEIC to JPG conversion using existing scripts
- Live completion handlers for real-time UI updates

## ‚ùå Current Issues

### 1. App Crashes During Process All
**Symptoms**: App becomes "not responding" then crashes when starting Process All
**Root Cause**: Unknown - crashes occur despite fixing multiple issues:
- ‚úÖ Fixed AttributeError with signal names (`processing_failed` vs `error`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues (`convert_heic_to_jpg` vs `convert_heic_to_jpeg`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed boolean vs path handling in HEIC conversion

### 2. Possible Threading Issues
**Concern**: The sequential processing approach may be causing GUI thread blocking
**Alternative**: Could use the existing proven workflow system instead of reimplementing

## üìÅ Recent File Changes

### September 8, 2025 - Accessibility Overhaul
**Commit**: `1c6716d` - "Improve accessibility by replacing tree widgets with list widgets"

**Modified Files**:
1. **`imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py`** (239 insertions, 136 deletions)
   - Replaced QTreeWidget with QListWidget for image list and description list
   - Updated all selection handling and data access methods  
   - Added emoji visual indicators (üé¨üìùüñºÔ∏è‚è≥‚úì)
   - Maintained visual hierarchy with indentation for video frames
   - Hidden master-detail view menu option (code preserved)
   - Preserved all existing functionality including batch processing

### Previous Changes
2. **`scripts/video_frame_extractor_config.json`** (timestamp update only)
   - Automatic config update from workflow runs

### Unmodified (Preserved Working Scripts)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/ConvertImage.py` - HEIC conversion logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` - Frame extraction logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/image_describer.py` - AI description logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow.py` - Proven workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow_utils.py` - Workflow utilities

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches to Consider

### Option 1: Use Existing Workflow System
Instead of reimplementing, call the existing `workflow.py` system:
- Proven to work reliably
- Handles HEIC, video frames, and descriptions
- Could integrate with GUI for live updates
- Less complex than current implementation

### Option 2: Simpler Process All
Revert to simpler approach:
- Use existing batch processing mechanism
- Add periodic UI updates during processing
- Focus on stability over new features

### Option 3: Debug Current Implementation
- Add extensive logging to identify crash point
- Use Qt debugging tools
- Simplify the live update mechanism

## üß™ Testing Status

### List Widget Accessibility Implementation: ‚úÖ WORKING
- QListWidget successfully replaced QTreeWidget for both image and description lists
- Visual hierarchy maintained with indentation for video frames
- All selection handling and data access methods updated
- Emoji indicators working for visual distinction
- Batch processing and description functionality preserved

### Previous Accessibility Features: ‚úÖ WORKING
- Custom tree widget announces items to screen reader
- Numeric inputs work with keyboard navigation
- Tab key properly moves focus in text areas

### Window Title Status: ‚úÖ WORKING  
- Filter status displays correctly in title bar
- Updates appropriately when filters change

### Video Frame Processing: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
- Basic functionality working but several UX/accessibility issues identified
- Focus management problems during processing
- Title bar status updates incomplete
- See tracked issues for details

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### For Resuming Work
1. **Identify Crash Cause**: Add logging/debugging to Process All workflow
2. **Consider Workflow Integration**: Evaluate using existing `workflow.py` instead
3. **Test Incrementally**: Start with simple operations and build up complexity
4. **Preserve Working Features**: Ensure accessibility improvements remain intact

### Alternative Quick Win
If crashes persist, consider implementing a simpler "Process Directory" that:
- Uses existing workflow system
- Shows progress in status bar
- Refreshes view when complete
- Provides the core functionality without complexity

## üêõ Tracked Issues for Future Implementation

### Issue #1: Video processing not showing in window title ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Videos being extracted now show processing status in window title  
**Solution**: Modified process_video() to add video to processing_items and call update_window_title()  

### Issue #2: Video extraction status indicators missing ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Videos show "E{count}" prefix after extraction, "‚è≥" during processing  
**Solution**: Updated refresh_view() to add "E{frame_count}" for extracted videos and processing indicators  

### Issue #3: Frame processing title bar not updating correctly ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Window title shows accurate progress like "Processing: 3 of 5 frames"  
**Solution**: Enhanced process_extracted_frames() with progress callbacks and modified update_window_title() to accept custom status messages  

### Issue #4: Title bar truncation with ellipsis ‚úÖ IMPROVED
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: IMPROVED - Custom status messages prevent truncation during processing  
**Solution**: update_window_title() now accepts custom_status parameter to prioritize processing messages  

### Issue #5: Focus loss during frame processing ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Focus now remains stable during processing operations  
**Solution**: Modified on_processing_complete() to avoid focus restoration during batch frame processing, only restore focus when all processing is complete

### Issue #6: Frame processing order ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: COMPLETED - Frames now process sequentially from first to last
**Solution**: Added sorting of frame_paths in process_extracted_frames() to ensure sequential processing

### Issue #7: Video dialog layout and defaults ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed dialog layout, defaults, and clarity
**Solutions**: 
- Moved "Process frames immediately" checkbox to top of processing section
- Set default model to "moondream" and prompt to "Narrative" to match main app
- Clarified end time label as "End Time (0=end)" to indicate 0 means end of video

### Issue #6: Focus not preserved in image list after processing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: When user navigates to an image, presses 'p' to process, and completes the dialog, focus returns to the top of the image list instead of staying on the processed image.  
**Expected**: Focus should remain on the image that was just processed.  
**Impact**: Poor UX for keyboard navigation and screen reader users.

### Issue #6: Focus not preserved in image list after processing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: When user navigates to an image, presses 'p' to process, and completes the dialog, focus returns to the top of the image list instead of staying on the processed image.  
**Expected**: Focus should remain on the image that was just processed.  
**Impact**: Poor UX for keyboard navigation and screen reader users.

### Issue #2: Add 'M' keyboard shortcut for manual descriptions
**Priority**: Low  
**Problem**: When focus is on image list or description list, should allow 'M' key to trigger manual description dialog.  
**Expected**: Press 'M' to quickly add manual description without using menu.  
**Impact**: Improved keyboard workflow efficiency.

### Issue #3: Follow-up questions for existing descriptions
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: No way to ask follow-up questions about existing AI descriptions.  
**Expected**: Add "Follow-up" menu item on description that uses same AI engine and allows follow-up questions.  
**Requirements**: 
- Use same model/settings as original description
- Provide edit box for follow-up question (Tab key must not be trapped)
- Context should include original description

### Issue #4: Title bar should show processing status
**Priority**: Low  
**Problem**: When processing single image (triggered with 'p'), title bar doesn't indicate processing.  
**Expected**: Title bar should show "Processing..." while retaining other info.  
**Impact**: User feedback during processing operations.

### Issue #5: Tab key still trapped in manual prompt edit box
**Priority**: High  
**Problem**: Despite fixes, Tab key is still being trapped in some edit boxes instead of moving focus.  
**Expected**: Tab should ALWAYS move focus, never insert tabs in ANY edit box.  
**Notes**: This was fixed in viewer app but still occurring in main app. Needs comprehensive fix across all text inputs.

## üîó Key Files to Review

- **Main GUI**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 2200-2400 for Process All)
- **Accessibility Classes**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 450-600)
- **Proven Workflow**: `scripts/workflow.py` (working alternative approach)
- **Workspace Handling**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 257-290)

## üí° User Experience Goals

The target workflow should be:
1. **Open app** ‚Üí Load image directory
2. **Click Process All** ‚Üí See live progress with descriptions appearing
3. **Read descriptions** as they roll in (like viewer app)
4. **Automatic handling** of HEIC files and video frames
5. **No manual steps** required

**Note**: All accessibility improvements are complete and working. The primary remaining task is making Process All stable and functional.
