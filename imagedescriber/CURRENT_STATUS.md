# ImageDescriber Current Status
**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Status**: Process All enhancements in progress - currently experiencing crashes

## üéØ What We Were Working On

### Primary Goal
Transform the Process All workflow to work like the viewer app with live updates - the main user workflow: "open app, process all, read descriptions as they roll in"

### Key Requirements Addressed
1. **Live Updates**: Show descriptions immediately as each image is processed (like viewer app)
2. **Comprehensive Processing**: Automatic HEIC conversion + video frame extraction + image description
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Fixed Qt6 tree view, numeric inputs, and Tab key behavior
4. **Window Title Filter Status**: Shows [All]/[Described]/[Batch] status
5. **New Workspace Bug**: Fixed endless "unsaved changes" loop

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Features

### 1. Accessibility Improvements (WORKING)
- **Custom AccessibleTreeWidget**: Replaces problematic QTreeWidget with screen reader support
- **Custom AccessibleNumericInput**: Replaces QSpinBox/QDoubleSpinBox with accessible QLineEdit + validation
- **Custom AccessibleTextEdit**: Fixed Tab key behavior (moves focus instead of inserting tabs)
- **Dynamic Announcements**: Screen reader announces items as they're added/processed
- **Preserved Business Logic**: All existing functionality maintained

### 2. Window Title Filter Status (WORKING)
- Shows current filter in title bar: `[All] - ImageDescriber` or `[Described] - ImageDescriber`
- Updates automatically when filter changes
- Includes batch processing status: `[Batch: 3/10] - ImageDescriber`

### 3. New Workspace Bug Fix (WORKING)
- Modified `ImageWorkspace.__init__(new_workspace=False)` parameter
- New workspaces start with `saved=True` to prevent endless unsaved changes warnings
- Properly integrated with File ‚Üí New Workspace functionality

### 4. Manual Description Feature (WORKING)
- **Add Manual Description**: New option in Descriptions menu
- **User Input**: Multi-line dialog for entering custom descriptions
- **Integration**: Manual descriptions appear in tree view with "manual manual: [text]" format
- **Workflow**: Select image ‚Üí Descriptions ‚Üí Add Manual Description ‚Üí Enter text
- **Auto-selection**: Newly added descriptions are automatically selected for viewing

## üîß Process All Implementation Status

### Current Implementation Approach
Attempted to create comprehensive processing with live updates by:
1. **HEIC Conversion**: Using existing `scripts/ConvertImage.py` functionality
2. **Video Frame Extraction**: Using existing `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` functionality  
3. **Sequential Processing**: Process images one by one with immediate UI updates
4. **Live Feedback**: Update tree view and descriptions as each item completes

### Key Methods Implemented
- `_start_comprehensive_processing()`: Main orchestrator
- `_process_images_with_live_updates()`: Sequential processing with UI updates
- `_extract_video_frames_with_defaults()`: Auto frame extraction (5-second intervals)
- `convert_heic_files()`: HEIC to JPG conversion using existing scripts
- Live completion handlers for real-time UI updates

## ‚ùå Current Issues

### 1. App Crashes During Process All
**Symptoms**: App becomes "not responding" then crashes when starting Process All
**Root Cause**: Unknown - crashes occur despite fixing multiple issues:
- ‚úÖ Fixed AttributeError with signal names (`processing_failed` vs `error`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues (`convert_heic_to_jpg` vs `convert_heic_to_jpeg`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed boolean vs path handling in HEIC conversion

### 2. Possible Threading Issues
**Concern**: The sequential processing approach may be causing GUI thread blocking
**Alternative**: Could use the existing proven workflow system instead of reimplementing

## üìÅ File Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **`imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py`** (116 insertions, 34 deletions)
   - Added custom accessibility classes
   - Enhanced Process All workflow
   - Fixed new workspace handling
   - Added window title filter status

2. **`scripts/video_frame_extractor_config.json`** (timestamp update only)
   - Automatic config update from workflow runs

### Unmodified (Preserved Working Scripts)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/ConvertImage.py` - HEIC conversion logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` - Frame extraction logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/image_describer.py` - AI description logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow.py` - Proven workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow_utils.py` - Workflow utilities

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches to Consider

### Option 1: Use Existing Workflow System
Instead of reimplementing, call the existing `workflow.py` system:
- Proven to work reliably
- Handles HEIC, video frames, and descriptions
- Could integrate with GUI for live updates
- Less complex than current implementation

### Option 2: Simpler Process All
Revert to simpler approach:
- Use existing batch processing mechanism
- Add periodic UI updates during processing
- Focus on stability over new features

### Option 3: Debug Current Implementation
- Add extensive logging to identify crash point
- Use Qt debugging tools
- Simplify the live update mechanism

## üß™ Testing Status

### Accessibility Features: ‚úÖ WORKING
- Custom tree widget announces items to screen reader
- Numeric inputs work with keyboard navigation
- Tab key properly moves focus in text areas

### Window Title Status: ‚úÖ WORKING  
- Filter status displays correctly in title bar
- Updates appropriately when filters change

### Process All: ‚ùå CRASHING
- App becomes unresponsive during comprehensive processing
- Crashes occur despite multiple bug fixes
- Root cause still unknown

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### For Resuming Work
1. **Identify Crash Cause**: Add logging/debugging to Process All workflow
2. **Consider Workflow Integration**: Evaluate using existing `workflow.py` instead
3. **Test Incrementally**: Start with simple operations and build up complexity
4. **Preserve Working Features**: Ensure accessibility improvements remain intact

### Alternative Quick Win
If crashes persist, consider implementing a simpler "Process Directory" that:
- Uses existing workflow system
- Shows progress in status bar
- Refreshes view when complete
- Provides the core functionality without complexity

## üîó Key Files to Review

- **Main GUI**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 2200-2400 for Process All)
- **Accessibility Classes**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 450-600)
- **Proven Workflow**: `scripts/workflow.py` (working alternative approach)
- **Workspace Handling**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 257-290)

## üí° User Experience Goals

The target workflow should be:
1. **Open app** ‚Üí Load image directory
2. **Click Process All** ‚Üí See live progress with descriptions appearing
3. **Read descriptions** as they roll in (like viewer app)
4. **Automatic handling** of HEIC files and video frames
5. **No manual steps** required

**Note**: All accessibility improvements are complete and working. The primary remaining task is making Process All stable and functional.
