# ImageDescriber Current Status
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Status**: Major accessibility improvements completed - List widget implementation working

## üéØ Latest Achievements

### Major Accessibility Overhaul (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Date**: September 8, 2025
**Goal**: Replace problematic tree widgets with accessible list widgets for better screen reader support

#### What Was Implemented
1. **QTreeWidget ‚Üí QListWidget Conversion**: Replaced both image tree and description tree with flat list widgets
2. **Visual Hierarchy Maintained**: Used indentation with `‚îî‚îÄ` characters to show video frames under parent videos
3. **Master-Detail View Hidden**: Removed menu option (code preserved) to focus users on accessible tree view
4. **Emoji Visual Indicators**: Added üé¨ (video), üìù (has descriptions), üñºÔ∏è (image), ‚è≥ (processing), ‚úì (batch marked)
5. **Complete Method Updates**: Updated all selection handling, data access, and UI refresh methods
6. **Preserved All Functionality**: Batch processing, descriptions, video frame extraction, etc. all maintained

#### Accessibility Benefits
- **Linear Navigation**: Screen readers can navigate through flat list linearly
- **Clear State Information**: Each item announces its type, status, and description count
- **No Expand/Collapse Complexity**: Eliminates confusing tree navigation for screen readers
- **Preserved Visual Structure**: Frames still appear logically under parent videos

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Features

### 1. Accessibility Improvements (WORKING)
- **Custom AccessibleTreeWidget**: Replaces problematic QTreeWidget with screen reader support
- **Custom AccessibleNumericInput**: Replaces QSpinBox/QDoubleSpinBox with accessible QLineEdit + validation
- **Custom AccessibleTextEdit**: Fixed Tab key behavior (moves focus instead of inserting tabs)
- **Dynamic Announcements**: Screen reader announces items as they're added/processed
- **Preserved Business Logic**: All existing functionality maintained

### 2. Window Title Filter Status (WORKING)
- Shows current filter in title bar: `[All] - ImageDescriber` or `[Described] - ImageDescriber`
- Updates automatically when filter changes
- Includes batch processing status: `[Batch: 3/10] - ImageDescriber`

### 3. New Workspace Bug Fix (WORKING)
- Modified `ImageWorkspace.__init__(new_workspace=False)` parameter
- New workspaces start with `saved=True` to prevent endless unsaved changes warnings
- Properly integrated with File ‚Üí New Workspace functionality

### 4. Manual Description Feature (WORKING)
- **Add Manual Description**: New option in Descriptions menu
- **User Input**: Multi-line dialog for entering custom descriptions
- **Integration**: Manual descriptions appear in tree view with "manual manual: [text]" format
- **Workflow**: Select image ‚Üí Descriptions ‚Üí Add Manual Description ‚Üí Enter text
- **Auto-selection**: Newly added descriptions are automatically selected for viewing

## üîß Process All Implementation Status

### Current Implementation Approach
Attempted to create comprehensive processing with live updates by:
1. **HEIC Conversion**: Using existing `scripts/ConvertImage.py` functionality
2. **Video Frame Extraction**: Using existing `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` functionality  
3. **Sequential Processing**: Process images one by one with immediate UI updates
4. **Live Feedback**: Update tree view and descriptions as each item completes

### Key Methods Implemented
- `_start_comprehensive_processing()`: Main orchestrator
- `_process_images_with_live_updates()`: Sequential processing with UI updates
- `_extract_video_frames_with_defaults()`: Auto frame extraction (5-second intervals)
- `convert_heic_files()`: HEIC to JPG conversion using existing scripts
- Live completion handlers for real-time UI updates

## ‚ùå Current Issues

### 1. App Crashes During Process All
**Symptoms**: App becomes "not responding" then crashes when starting Process All
**Root Cause**: Unknown - crashes occur despite fixing multiple issues:
- ‚úÖ Fixed AttributeError with signal names (`processing_failed` vs `error`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues (`convert_heic_to_jpg` vs `convert_heic_to_jpeg`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed boolean vs path handling in HEIC conversion

### 2. Possible Threading Issues
**Concern**: The sequential processing approach may be causing GUI thread blocking
**Alternative**: Could use the existing proven workflow system instead of reimplementing

## üìÅ Recent File Changes

### September 8, 2025 - Accessibility Overhaul
**Commit**: `1c6716d` - "Improve accessibility by replacing tree widgets with list widgets"

**Modified Files**:
1. **`imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py`** (239 insertions, 136 deletions)
   - Replaced QTreeWidget with QListWidget for image list and description list
   - Updated all selection handling and data access methods  
   - Added emoji visual indicators (üé¨üìùüñºÔ∏è‚è≥‚úì)
   - Maintained visual hierarchy with indentation for video frames
   - Hidden master-detail view menu option (code preserved)
   - Preserved all existing functionality including batch processing

### Previous Changes
2. **`scripts/video_frame_extractor_config.json`** (timestamp update only)
   - Automatic config update from workflow runs

### Unmodified (Preserved Working Scripts)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/ConvertImage.py` - HEIC conversion logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/video_frame_extractor.py` - Frame extraction logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/image_describer.py` - AI description logic
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow.py` - Proven workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ `scripts/workflow_utils.py` - Workflow utilities

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches to Consider

### Option 1: Use Existing Workflow System
Instead of reimplementing, call the existing `workflow.py` system:
- Proven to work reliably
- Handles HEIC, video frames, and descriptions
- Could integrate with GUI for live updates
- Less complex than current implementation

### Option 2: Simpler Process All
Revert to simpler approach:
- Use existing batch processing mechanism
- Add periodic UI updates during processing
- Focus on stability over new features

### Option 3: Debug Current Implementation
- Add extensive logging to identify crash point
- Use Qt debugging tools
- Simplify the live update mechanism

## üß™ Testing Status

### List Widget Accessibility Implementation: ‚úÖ WORKING
- QListWidget successfully replaced QTreeWidget for both image and description lists
- Visual hierarchy maintained with indentation for video frames
- All selection handling and data access methods updated
- Emoji indicators working for visual distinction
- Batch processing and description functionality preserved

### Previous Accessibility Features: ‚úÖ WORKING
- Custom tree widget announces items to screen reader
- Numeric inputs work with keyboard navigation
- Tab key properly moves focus in text areas

### Window Title Status: ‚úÖ WORKING  
- Filter status displays correctly in title bar
- Updates appropriately when filters change

### Video Frame Processing: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
- Basic functionality working but several UX/accessibility issues identified
- Focus management problems during processing
- Title bar status updates incomplete
- See tracked issues for details

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### For Resuming Work
1. **Identify Crash Cause**: Add logging/debugging to Process All workflow
2. **Consider Workflow Integration**: Evaluate using existing `workflow.py` instead
3. **Test Incrementally**: Start with simple operations and build up complexity
4. **Preserve Working Features**: Ensure accessibility improvements remain intact

### Alternative Quick Win
If crashes persist, consider implementing a simpler "Process Directory" that:
- Uses existing workflow system
- Shows progress in status bar
- Refreshes view when complete
- Provides the core functionality without complexity

## üêõ Tracked Issues for Future Implementation

### Issue #1: Video processing not showing in window title
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: When videos are being extracted, the window title should show processing status but currently doesn't.  
**Expected**: Window title should indicate "Extracting frames..." or similar during video frame extraction.  
**Impact**: Users don't get feedback about video processing operations.

### Issue #2: Video extraction status indicators missing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: After frames have been extracted, the video should be prefaced with an "E" and the number of frames that were extracted. While frames are being extracted, the video should get a "p" (processing indicator), just as images do.  
**Expected**: "E5 video.mp4" after extraction of 5 frames, "p video.mp4" during extraction.  
**Impact**: No visual feedback about extraction status or results.

### Issue #3: Frame processing title bar not updating correctly
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: When frames are being processed after using the option to extract frames and process them, the title bar is not updating as frames are being processed. It always shows the same number.  
**Expected**: Title bar should show current progress like "Processing: 3 of 5 frames".  
**Impact**: Inaccurate progress feedback during batch frame processing.

### Issue #4: Title bar truncation with ellipsis
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: Sometimes the title bar has truncation and shows "...". Visually this is fine but for accessibility should not happen.  
**Expected**: Full text should always be available to screen readers, even if visually truncated.  
**Impact**: Screen readers may not get complete status information.

### Issue #5: Focus loss during frame processing
**Priority**: High  
**Problem**: When frame processing is happening after extracting frames from a video, focus is getting lost and jumping to the top of the list again each time a frame is processed.  
**Expected**: Focus should remain stable during processing so user can read descriptions as they become available and potentially ask follow-up questions while other processing continues.  
**Impact**: Major accessibility issue - prevents users from interacting with results while processing continues.

### Issue #6: Focus not preserved in image list after processing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: When user navigates to an image, presses 'p' to process, and completes the dialog, focus returns to the top of the image list instead of staying on the processed image.  
**Expected**: Focus should remain on the image that was just processed.  
**Impact**: Poor UX for keyboard navigation and screen reader users.

### Issue #2: Add 'M' keyboard shortcut for manual descriptions
**Priority**: Low  
**Problem**: When focus is on image list or description list, should allow 'M' key to trigger manual description dialog.  
**Expected**: Press 'M' to quickly add manual description without using menu.  
**Impact**: Improved keyboard workflow efficiency.

### Issue #3: Follow-up questions for existing descriptions
**Priority**: Medium  
**Problem**: No way to ask follow-up questions about existing AI descriptions.  
**Expected**: Add "Follow-up" menu item on description that uses same AI engine and allows follow-up questions.  
**Requirements**: 
- Use same model/settings as original description
- Provide edit box for follow-up question (Tab key must not be trapped)
- Context should include original description

### Issue #4: Title bar should show processing status
**Priority**: Low  
**Problem**: When processing single image (triggered with 'p'), title bar doesn't indicate processing.  
**Expected**: Title bar should show "Processing..." while retaining other info.  
**Impact**: User feedback during processing operations.

### Issue #5: Tab key still trapped in manual prompt edit box
**Priority**: High  
**Problem**: Despite fixes, Tab key is still being trapped in some edit boxes instead of moving focus.  
**Expected**: Tab should ALWAYS move focus, never insert tabs in ANY edit box.  
**Notes**: This was fixed in viewer app but still occurring in main app. Needs comprehensive fix across all text inputs.

## üîó Key Files to Review

- **Main GUI**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 2200-2400 for Process All)
- **Accessibility Classes**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 450-600)
- **Proven Workflow**: `scripts/workflow.py` (working alternative approach)
- **Workspace Handling**: `imagedescriber/imagedescriber.py` (lines 257-290)

## üí° User Experience Goals

The target workflow should be:
1. **Open app** ‚Üí Load image directory
2. **Click Process All** ‚Üí See live progress with descriptions appearing
3. **Read descriptions** as they roll in (like viewer app)
4. **Automatic handling** of HEIC files and video frames
5. **No manual steps** required

**Note**: All accessibility improvements are complete and working. The primary remaining task is making Process All stable and functional.
