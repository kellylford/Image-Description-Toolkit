## üöÄ Enable AI Features (Recommended)

To unlock **AI-powered image descriptions**, you need to set up at least ONE AI provider. Choose based on your needs:

### üåü Recommended: Ollama (Local, Free, Private)

**Best for**: Most users, completely free, works offline, privacy-focused

**What it does**: Uses local AI models (like ChatGPT but running on your computer)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

**Steps**:

1. **Download Ollama** from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/download/windows)
   - Size: ~250MB installer
   - Requires: Windows 10/11

2. **Install and Start Ollama**
   - Run the installer
   - Ollama starts automatically in the background
   - Look for Ollama icon in system tray

3. **Download a Vision Model**
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Run: `ollama pull llava:7b`
   - Wait 5-10 minutes (downloads ~4GB model)
   - Alternative models: `llava:13b` (better quality, slower) or `moondream` (faster, smaller)

4. **Verify Setup**
   - In ImageDescriber, create/open a workspace
   - Click "Process Images" button
   - Select provider: **Ollama**
   - Choose model: **llava:7b**
   - Select an image and click "Process Selected"

**‚úÖ You're done!** Ollama will generate AI descriptions locally.

### ‚ö° Optional: Object Detection (YOLO)

**Best for**: Counting objects, detecting specific items, precise analysis

**What it does**: Detects and counts objects (people, cars, animals, etc.) with bounding boxes

**Setup time**: 2-3 minutes

**Steps**:

1. **Run the setup batch file** (included with ImageDescriber)
   - Double-click: **setup_imagedescriber.bat**
   - OR manually: `pip install ultralytics`

2. **Verify Setup**
   - Restart ImageDescriber
   - Look for **"Object Detection"** in the provider dropdown
   - If it appears, you're all set!

**Usage**:
- Provider: **Object Detection**
- Adjust settings: Confidence threshold, max objects, YOLO model size
- Best for: Counting people, vehicles, animals; detecting specific objects

**Note**: YOLO detects 80 common objects (COCO dataset). It won't recognize artistic objects like sculptures, paintings, or specialized items.

---

### üéØ Optional: GroundingDINO (Text-Prompted Object Detection)

**Best for**: Detecting ANY object you describe, unlimited flexibility, works in chat

**What it does**: Detects objects based on text descriptions - no preset limits!

**Requirements**: Python packages (torch, torchvision, groundingdino-py)

**Setup time**: 5 minutes + ~700MB model download on first use

**Steps**:

1. **Install GroundingDINO**
   ```bash
   pip install groundingdino-py torch torchvision
   ```

2. **First Use Model Download**
   - First time you use GroundingDINO, it downloads ~700MB model
   - This happens automatically
   - Subsequent uses are instant (model is cached)

3. **Verify Installation**
   - In ImageDescriber provider dropdown, look for:
     - **GroundingDINO** (standalone detection)
     - **GroundingDINO + Ollama** (detection + descriptions)

**Usage**:

**Option 1: Preset Detection Modes**
- Provider: **GroundingDINO** or **GroundingDINO + Ollama**
- Detection Mode: **Automatic**
- Choose preset: Comprehensive, Indoor, Outdoor, Workplace, Safety, Retail, Document
- Adjust confidence threshold (default 25%)

**Option 2: Custom Queries** (The Power Feature!)
- Provider: **GroundingDINO** or **GroundingDINO + Ollama**
- Detection Mode: **Custom Query**
- Type what to find: "red cars . blue trucks . motorcycles"
- Separate items with " . " (period with spaces)

**Example Queries**:
- `red cars . blue trucks . motorcycles`
- `people wearing helmets . safety equipment`
- `fire exits . emergency signs . first aid kits`
- `logos . text . diagrams`
- `damaged items . missing parts`

**Chat Integration** (Chat-based Detection):
- Select an image in the workspace
- Open or continue a chat session
- Type natural queries:
  - "find red cars"
  - "detect people wearing hats"
  - "show me safety equipment"
  - "locate fire exits"
- GroundingDINO automatically detects and responds!

**Advantages over YOLO**:
- ‚úÖ Unlimited object types (YOLO limited to 80)
- ‚úÖ Describe attributes: colors, states, conditions
- ‚úÖ Natural language: "person wearing hat" not just "person"
- ‚úÖ Works in chat with conversational queries
- ‚úÖ Hybrid mode: Combines detection with Ollama descriptions

**Note**: First use downloads ~700MB model automatically. Requires internet connection for initial download only.

### üî• Optional: Enhanced ONNX (Hybrid: YOLO + Ollama)

**Best for**: Maximum accuracy, combining object detection with AI descriptions

**What it does**: YOLO detects objects first, then Ollama describes the image using both vision and detection data

**Requirements**: Both Ollama AND YOLO must be installed

**Setup time**: 3-5 minutes (after Ollama and YOLO are set up)

**Steps**:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**
   - ‚úÖ Ollama installed and running (see above)
   - ‚úÖ YOLO installed (see above)

2. **Download ONNX Models** (optional, for faster inference)
   - Double-click: **download_onnx_models.bat** (included with ImageDescriber, source: models/)
   - Wait 5-10 minutes (downloads ~230MB of optimized models)
   - These models are pre-optimized for faster CPU/GPU inference

3. **Verify Setup**
   - In ImageDescriber provider dropdown, look for:
     - **Enhanced ONNX** (basic)
     - **Enhanced ONNX with Spatial Details** (includes object locations)
     - **Enhanced ONNX with Comprehensive Details** (full analysis)

**Usage**:
- Provider: Choose an Enhanced ONNX variant

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Ollama provider not available"

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Ollama is running (look for icon in system tray)
2. Restart Ollama: Exit from system tray, then start again
3. Test connection: Open browser to [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434)
4. Reinstall Ollama if needed

### "Object Detection provider not showing"

**Solutions**:
1. Run: **setup_imagedescriber.bat** (included with ImageDescriber)
2. OR manually: `pip install ultralytics`
3. Restart ImageDescriber
4. Check: Provider dropdown should now show "Object Detection"

### "Unable to load image" errors

**Solutions**:
1. ImageDescriber supports: JPG, PNG, HEIC, BMP, GIF
2. For HEIC files, ensure they're valid (try opening in Windows Photos)
3. Check file isn't corrupted
4. Try converting to JPG first

### "Processing failed" with Ollama

**Possible causes**:
1. Model not downloaded: Run `ollama pull llava:7b`
2. Ollama not running: Check system tray
3. Image too large: Resize to under 4K resolution
4. Insufficient memory: Close other applications
5. Model busy: Wait for previous processing to complete

### Models are slow

**Solutions**:
1. Use smaller models: `moondream` or `llava:7b` instead of `llava:13b`
2. Use GPU: Ollama auto-detects GPU if available
3. Close other applications: Free up RAM
4. For Copilot+ PC: Use Copilot+ provider for NPU acceleration
5. For cloud: Consider OpenAI provider (faster but costs money)

### "API key invalid" (OpenAI/HuggingFace)

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check key/token copied correctly
2. Ensure no extra spaces before/after
3. Check key is still valid on provider website
4. Regenerate new key if needed
5. Verify payment method (OpenAI) or account status
