‚ùå WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (Optional Add-ons)
================================================================================

These features require separate installation but add AI-powered capabilities:

‚ö†Ô∏è OLLAMA (Required for AI Descriptions)
  What: Local AI models that generate image descriptions
  Cost: FREE
  Size: ~250MB installer + ~2-8GB per model
  Setup: Download from ollama.ai/download
  Why needed: Provides the actual AI that "looks" at images
  Works offline: YES (completely local and private)
  
  Models to download after installing Ollama:
    - llava:7b (Recommended, 4GB) - Good balance of speed and quality
    - moondream (2GB) - Fastest, smaller model
    - llava:13b (8GB) - Best quality, slower
  
  Setup command: ollama pull llava:7b

‚ö†Ô∏è YOLO / ULTRALYTICS (Optional - Object Detection)
  What: Computer vision for detecting and counting objects
  Cost: FREE
  Size: ~50MB
  Setup: pip install ultralytics
  Why needed: Enables "Object Detection" provider
  Features: Counts people, cars, animals, furniture, etc. (80 object types)
  Works with: Pure object detection OR Enhanced ONNX hybrid
  
  Note: YOLO recognizes everyday objects (COCO dataset). It won't detect
        specialized items like sculptures, paintings, or artwork.

‚ö†Ô∏è GROUNDINGDINO (Optional - Text-Prompted Object Detection)
  What: Advanced AI that detects ANY object you describe in text
  Cost: FREE
  Size: ~700MB (model downloads automatically on first use)
  Setup: pip install groundingdino-py torch torchvision
  Why needed: Enables "GroundingDINO" and "GroundingDINO + Ollama" providers
  Features: Unlimited object types! Just describe what to find:
    - "red cars and blue trucks"
    - "people wearing safety helmets"
    - "fire exits and emergency signs"
    - "documents with logos"
  Works offline: YES (after model downloads)
  Works in chat: YES (type "find red cars" and it detects them)
  
  Advantages over YOLO:
    - Unlimited object types (YOLO limited to 80)
    - Describe specific attributes (colors, states, details)
    - Natural language queries ("person wearing hat" not just "person")
    - Hybrid mode combines detection with Ollama descriptions

‚ö†Ô∏è ONNX MODELS (Optional - Performance Enhancement)
  What: Pre-optimized AI models for faster inference
  Cost: FREE
  Size: ~230MB
  Setup: Run download_onnx_models.bat (included with ImageDescriber)
  Why needed: Speeds up Enhanced ONNX provider significantly
  Requires: Ollama + YOLO already installed
  Works offline: YES (after download)

‚ö†Ô∏è OPENAI API KEY (Optional - Cloud AI)
  What: Access to GPT-4 Vision (like ChatGPT Plus)
  Cost: PAID (~$0.01-0.03 per image, pay-as-you-go)
  Size: N/A (cloud service)
  Setup: Sign up at platform.openai.com, get API key
  Why needed: Highest quality descriptions, but costs money
  Works offline: NO (requires internet)

‚ö†Ô∏è HUGGINGFACE TOKEN (Optional - Model Hub)
  What: Access to thousands of AI models on HuggingFace
  Cost: FREE (for most models)
  Size: Varies by model (typically 100MB - 10GB)
  Setup: Sign up at huggingface.co, get read token
  Why needed: Experiment with different AI architectures
  Works offline: Some models (after download)

üìÅ FILES INCLUDED WITH IMAGEDESCRIBER
================================================================================

When you extracted/downloaded ImageDescriber, you should have:

REQUIRED (Must have):
  ‚úì ImageDescriber.exe (or ImageDescriber_amd64.exe / ImageDescriber_arm64.exe)
  ‚úì This file: WHATS_INCLUDED.txt

HELPFUL (Recommended to keep):
  ‚úì USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md - Detailed setup instructions

  ‚úì download_onnx_models.bat - ONNX model downloader (optional)

OPTIONAL (Can delete if not needed):
  - Any .spec or build files (development artifacts)
  - __pycache__ folders (Python cache, not needed for .exe)


üíæ DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

ImageDescriber.exe:          ~30-50 MB (the app itself)

Optional add-ons:
  Ollama installer:          ~250 MB
  Ollama llava:7b model:     ~4 GB
  Ollama moondream model:    ~2 GB  
  Ollama llava:13b model:    ~8 GB
  YOLO ultralytics:          ~50 MB
  ONNX models:               ~230 MB

Realistic setup:
  Minimal (no AI):           50 MB (just ImageDescriber.exe)
  Recommended:               ~4.5 GB (ImageDescriber + Ollama + llava:7b + YOLO)
  Maximum:                   ~9 GB (everything including large models)


üîß TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q: Why can't I see AI providers like "Ollama" or "Object Detection"?
A: These require external software. See "WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED" above.
   Run setup_imagedescriber.bat to install missing components.

Q: The app says "Python not found" but I just want to use it!
A: ImageDescriber.exe includes Python! This message appears only if you
   try to use features requiring external Python packages (YOLO, ONNX).
   For basic use (manual descriptions, HTML export), ignore this message.

Q: Do I need to install Python separately?
A: NO - for basic use, Python is included in ImageDescriber.exe.
   YES - only if you want object detection (YOLO) or ONNX models.

Q: Why does ImageDescriber.exe take a while to start the first time?
A: PyInstaller extracts bundled files on first run. Subsequent starts
   will be much faster. This is normal.

Q: Can I use ImageDescriber without internet?
A: YES - After initial setup:
   - Core features work offline (always)
   - Ollama works offline (local AI)
   - YOLO works offline (local detection)
   - ONNX works offline (local models)
   - OpenAI does NOT work offline (cloud API)

Q: Where are my workspaces saved?
A: Workspaces are saved wherever you create them. Each workspace is a
   JSON file containing your image paths, descriptions, and settings.
   The .exe doesn't store anything - you control all files.

Q: Can I move ImageDescriber.exe to another computer?
A: YES - Copy the .exe anywhere. It's fully portable!
   If you set up optional features (Ollama, YOLO), install them on the
   new computer too. Run setup_imagedescriber.bat to check status.

   - Then add Ollama (10 minutes) for AI descriptions
   - Then add YOLO (5 minutes) for object detection
   - Don't install everything at once - add features as needed!
