# Gallery Deployment Ready - October 25, 2025

## Summary

✅ **COMPLETE**: Both cottage and europe galleries are now deployment-ready with correct ARIA accessibility.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ARIA Label Issue (Root Cause Found)

**Problem**: Europe gallery had verbose screen reader announcements:
- ❌ BAD: "Image 25: photo-19500.jpg - Sunny urban plaza... Button"
- ✅ GOOD: "Sunny urban plaza... Button"

**Root Cause**: Code had drifted from the clean **commit 6de91fb** (Oct 24, 2025) which properly removed aria-labels.

**Solution**: Removed ALL `setAttribute('aria-label', ...)` calls from:
- `loadAltTextForItem()` function (3 locations removed)
- `createDescriptionCard()` function (1 location removed)
- Image browser item creation (1 location removed)

### 2. Files Fixed

✅ **tools/ImageGallery/index.html** - Root template (now matches 6de91fb)  
✅ **cottage/webdeploy/index.html** - Cottage gallery deployment  
✅ **europe/webdeploy/index.html** - Europe gallery deployment

**Verification**: All three files now have **ZERO** `setAttribute('aria-label'` calls.

## Documentation Created

### 1. ARIA_EVALUATION_OCT24.md
Complete evaluation documenting:
- Why aria-labels were removed (caused triple announcements)
- What was changed in commit 6de91fb
- Correct vs incorrect code examples
- Screen reader testing results

### 2. TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST.md
Step-by-step checklist for creating new galleries:
- Template source (commit 6de91fb)
- Required customizations (title, images, JSON)
- Pre-upload verification steps
- Common issues and fixes
- Testing procedures

### 3. ARCHITECTURE.md (Updated)
Added prominent references to:
- TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST.md
- ARIA_EVALUATION_OCT24.md
- Commit 6de91fb as source of truth
