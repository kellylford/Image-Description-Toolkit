Claude Haiku: I apologize, but I cannot generate alt text without seeing the actual image. The description you provided seems to be a technical assessment of image quality, not a description of the image's contents. To create meaningful alt text, I would need to see the specific image and understand its visual elements, subjects, and key details.

If you can upload or describe the image's actual contents (what is in the scene, who or what is depicted), I can help you craft an appropriate alt text description
